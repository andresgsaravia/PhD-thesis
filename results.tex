\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

We performed a series of diagonalizations of the hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) using the parameters described in section \ref{sec:model-parameters} with variable charge-lattice coupling with the asymmetric (infrared) mode, $\lambda_{ir}$. 
We took $\lambda_{ir}$ values in the representative range from 0 eV to 0.25 eV. 
This range allowed us to explore the behaviour in the small, middle and strong coupling regimes. 
Besides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian we also calculated the mean (infrared and Raman) phonons with their dispersions and the projections into phonon coordinates $(u_{ir}, u_R)$ as discussed in section \ref{sec:lattice-distortions}.

We start this chapter with section \ref{sec:classification} describing the general nature of the different excitations. 
In section \ref{sec:irSpectra} we calculate some features that should be present in the infrared spectra followed, in section \label{sec:irIsotopicShifts}, by a description of the effects that the isotopic $^{16}$O$\rightarrow ^{18}$O has in the spectra. 
Finally we conclude in section \label{sec:irPhononProj} with some observations about the projections into the phonon coordinates.

In appendix \ref{chap:comp_details} we discuss more details about the calculations, such as the algorithm used and the errors introduced by the truncation in the basis.

\section{Classification of the excitations}
\label{sec:classification}

As previously noted in section \ref{sec:hamiltonian-and-basis}, only for zero charge-lattice couplings the eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) can be described as a direct product of purely electronic (an eigenstate of $H_{el}$) and phononic (an eigenstate of $H_{ph}$) states. 
That is, when the coupling parameters are zero the phonon number opreators $b_Rb^\dagger_R$ and $b_{ir}b^\dagger_{ir}$ have integer values with zero dispersion.
Increasing the value of the coupling parameters produces eigenstates with different mean phonon values and some finite dispersion.
In this scenario, the eigenstates are not striclty \textit{phononic}, \textit{electronic} or a product of both. 
The transition from this purely electronic or phononic states to a mixture of both, as a function of the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$ is smooth.
That is, a hamiltonian with a small $\lambda_{ir}$ value will have only slighty different eigenstates from the uncoupled hamiltonian.
This mixed eigenstates can be thought of as largely phononic or electronic in nature.
For large coupling values the eigenstates are very different and can not be easily related to they uncoupled counterparts.
In figure \ref{fig:electr-proj} we show the first electronic state, for different $\lambda_{ir}$ values, projected with the first electronic state in the uncoupled system.
From this projection we can see that for small coupling values the electronic eigenstate remains largely unchanged.
In the middle coupling regime the change is strongest and then approaches zero at larger couplings.
This means that for small enough coupling values, this state remains \textit{electronic} in nature.
The vertical line in \ref{fig:electr-proj} at $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV, as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:grd-phonon-proj}, represents the $\lambda_{ir}$ value that reproduces the experimentally observed cluster distortion.
At this coupling value the electronic eigenstate has a projection with its uncoupled counterpart of $\sim 0.75$ which indicates that, although it has been changed considerably by the charge-lattice coupling, remains mostly electronic in nature.
Similar phenomenology can be observed for the rest of the excitations in this model.
Even though the eigenstates, for finite charge-lattice couplings, are not strictly electronic or phononic we will continue to refer to them as such since that interpretation remains useful in the regime of interest to us.

\section{Infrared spectra}
\label{sec:irSpectra}

Figure \ref{fig:irSpectra} shows the infrared-active excitations for a range of $\lambda_{ir}$ values.
Note that, due to dipole selection rules, the excitation with two infrared phonons (green) is not visible with infared spectroscopy.

  The red, green and blue lines denote excitations which, initially, have one, two and three infrared phonons respectively.
  The horizontal dashed line is placed at the first infared-active excitation $\omega_i=612.4$ cm$^{-1}$ as a guide to the eye.}

At large $\lambda_{ir}$ we recover the harmonic behaviour. This is analog to have a spring with a displaced equilibrium position.


\section{Isotopic shifts}

The isotopic shifts are different:
