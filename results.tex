\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

We performed a series of diagonalizations of the hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) using the parameters described in section \ref{sec:model-parameters} with variable charge-lattice coupling with the asymmetric (infrared) mode, $\lambda_{ir}$. 
We took $\lambda_{ir}$ values in the representative range from 0 eV to 0.25 eV. 
This range allowed us to explore the behaviour in the small, middle and strong coupling regimes. 
Besides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian we also calculated the mean (infrared and Raman) phonons with their dispersions and the projections into phonon coordinates $(u_{ir}, u_R)$ as discussed in section \ref{sec:lattice-distortions}.

We start this chapter with section \ref{sec:classification} describing the general nature of the different excitations. 
In section \ref{sec:irSpectra} we calculate some features that should be present in the infrared spectra followed, in section \ref{sec:irIsotopicShifts}, by a description of the effects that the isotopic $^{16}$O$\rightarrow ^{18}$O has in the spectra. 
Finally we conclude in section \ref{sec:irPhononProj} with some observations about the projections into the phonon coordinates.

In appendix \ref{chap:comp_details} we discuss more details about the calculations, such as the algorithm used and the errors introduced by the truncation in the basis.

\section{Classification of the excitations}
\label{sec:classification}

As previously noted in section \ref{sec:hamiltonian-and-basis}, only for zero charge-lattice couplings the eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) can be described as a direct product of an electronic (an eigenstate of $H_{el}$) and a phononic (an eigenstate of $H_{ph}$) state.
That is, when the coupling parameters are zero the phonon number opreators $b_Rb^\dagger_R$ and $b_{ir}b^\dagger_{ir}$ have integer values with zero dispersion.
Increasing the value of the coupling parameters produces eigenstates with different mean phonon values and some finite dispersion.
In this scenario, the eigenstates can not be separated as a product of phononic and electronic states.
The deviation from this product of purely electronic and phononic states, as a function of the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$, is smooth.
That is, a hamiltonian with a small $\lambda_{ir}$ value will have only slighty different eigenstates from the uncoupled hamiltonian.
This mixed eigenstates, in the small couping regime, can be thought of as largely \textit{phononic} or \textit{electronic} in nature.
For larger coupling values the eigenstates are very different from their uncoupled counterparts.
As an illustration of this we show, in figure \ref{fig:electr-proj}, the first electronic excitation for different $\lambda_{ir}$ values, $\psi_{el}(\lambda_{ir})$ projected with itself for the uncoupled system ($\lambda_{ir}=0$).
From this projection we can see that for small coupling values $\psi_{el}$ remains largely unchanged.
This means that for small enough coupling values, this state remains \textit{electronic} in nature.
In the middle coupling regime the change is strongest with the projection approaching asymptotically to large couplings.
The vertical line in \ref{fig:electr-proj} at $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV, as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:grd-phonon-proj}, represents the $\lambda_{ir}$ value that reproduces the experimentally observed cluster distortion of 0.13 \AA.
At this coupling value the electronic eigenstate has a projection with its uncoupled counterpart near $\sim 0.75$ which indicates that, although it has been somewhat changed, it remains mostly \textit{electronic} in nature.
Similar observations can be made for the rest of the excitations in this model.
For this reason even though the eigenstates, for finite charge-lattice couplings, are not strictly electronic or phononic we will continue to refer to them as such since that interpretation remains useful in the regime of interest to us.

\end{figure}

Given the possibility of making such a distinction for the different excitations we will discuss \textit{phononic} and \textit{electronic} excitations separatedly. 
Since we are setting the charge-lattice coupling parameter to the symmetrical (Raman) vibrational mode ($\lambda_R$) as zero and these excitations are unchanged by an increase in $\lambda_{ir}$ all excitations will have a definite eigenvalue for the Raman number operator $b_R^\dagger b_R$. 
An excitation which, at $\lambda_{ir}=0$, has an eigenvalue of zero for the infrared number operator $b_{ir}^\dagger b_{ir}$ and the electronic part of the hamiltonian $H_{el}$ (i.e. a purely \textit{Raman} excitation) will remain unchanged with a variation of $\lambda_{ir}$.
We will obviate any discussion about these excitations and ignore them for the rest of this thesis. 


\section{Infrared spectra}
\label{sec:irSpectra}

Figure \ref{fig:irSpectra} shows the infrared-active excitations for a range of $\lambda_{ir}$ values.
Note that, due to dipole selection rules, the excitation with two infrared phonons (green) is not visible with infared spectroscopy.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \input{images/irSpectra}
  \caption[Infrared-active excitations as a function of electron-lattice coupling.]
  {Infrared-active excitations as a function of electron-lattice coupling.
  The red, green and blue lines denote excitations which, initially, have one, two and three infrared phonons respectively.
  The horizontal dashed line is placed at the first infared-active excitation $\omega_i=612.4$ cm$^{-1}$ as a guide to the eye.}
  \label{fig:irSpectra}
\end{figure}

At zero coupling the ir spectra is at 612.4, 1112.4, 1612.4, 1873.2.
At $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV is at 142.39, 641.39, 774.25, 1141.4 

At large $\lambda_{ir}$ we recover the harmonic behaviour. This is analog to have a spring with a displaced equilibrium position.
