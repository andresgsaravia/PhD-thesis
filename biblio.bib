abstract = {It is shown that the collective electron and London-Heitler models are not to be regarded as different approximations to the same exact wave function for solids in which, according to the former model, there is a partially filled zone of energy levels. It can thus be shown why nickel oxide in the pure state is a non-conductor, although it contains an incomplete zone. The properties of the metals nickel, palladium and platinum are discussed in the light of these results; platinum differs from nickel in that the orbital contribution to the moment of the elementary magnets is not quenched. A discussion is given of x-ray absorption edges, and it is shown why exciton lines are absent for metals.},

@article{Anderson1987,
abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La(2)CuO(4), have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

abstract = {Copper K-edge x-ray absorption data indicate that an axial oxygen-centered lattice instability accompanying the 93 K superconducting transition in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is of a pseudo-(anti)ferroelectric type, in that it appears to involve the softening of a double potential well into a structure in which the difference between the two copper-oxygen distances and the barrier height have both decreased. This softer structure is present only at temperatures within a fluctuation region around the transition. A similar process involving the analogous axial oxygen atom also accompanies the superconducting transition in T1Ba(2)Ca(3)Cu(4)O(11), where the superconducting transition temperature T(c) is \~{}120 K. The mean square relative displacement of this oxygen atom in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is also specifically affected by a reduction in the oxygen content and by the substitution of cobalt for copper, providing further evidence for the sensitivity of the displacement to additional factors that also influence the superconductivity. On the basis of the implied coupling of this ionic motion to the superconductivity, a scenario for high-temperature superconductivity is presented in which both phonon and electronic (charge transfer) channels are synergistically involved.},

abstract = {The infrared-active phonon spectra of YBa2(CoxCu1-x)3O7-δ (0⩽x⩽0.07) have been studied between 35 K and room temperature. The mode near 580 cm$^{-1}$ depends sensitively on Co doping and renormalizes due to the metal-superconductor phase transition. The excess phonon frequency and absorption cross-section scale as the square of the order parameter in the superconducting phase. This temperature evolution is in accordance with Landau-Ginzburg theory including saturation effects, which is numerically similar to BCS behaviour. Phonon contributions to the specific heat as a function of Co content correlate closely with observed anomalies in calorimetric measurements, indicating that phonons contribute intrinsically to the transition mechanism, e.g. via Bose condensation of structural bipolarons. The growth of a phonon doublet at ≈657 cm$^{-1}$ is attributed to effects of Co doping and discussed in view of the orthorhombic to tetragonal structural phase transitions at x≈0.025 and δ≈0.5 in the YBa2Cu3O7-δ end-member.},

For large enough electron–infrared-phonon coupling the motion of holes and ions becomes strongly correlated, i.e., polaronic, leading to a double-well structure for the infrared mode, as encountered in x-ray-absorption fine structure. In contrast, the associated Raman mode shows a single-well behavior even for large electron–Raman-phonon coupling. The appearance of polarons accompanies nonadiabatic behavior yielding optical spectroscopy predictions differing from those obtained from harmonic or anharmonic lattice dynamics models.},

abstract = {Using Raman spectroscopy and far-infrared ellipsometry we have investigated several YBa2Cu3O7 ceram- ics which were made from different isotopically pure Cu or Ba precursors. The observed shifts of Raman- and infrared-active phonons reveal insight into their relative Ba and Cu normal mode content. This allows us to examine mode eigenvectors obtained from lattice dynamical calculations. Our Raman results demonstrate that the 121 cm1 and 153 cm1 Ag phonons are only very weakly mixed and represent almost pure Ba and Cu vibrations, respectively, whereas they suggest considerable Ba-Cu-O mixing in the case of the B2g and B3g phonons at 140 cm1 and 142 cm1. The analysis of the infrared-active B1u modes yields a substantial contribution of Cu to the 150 cm1 and the 280 cm1 phonons and of Ba to the 150 cm1 mode. Making use of proposed eigenvectors, which are shown to be compatible with the observed isotope shifts, we determine effective charges for all ions from measured infrared oscillator strengths on a YBa2Cu3O7 crystal. We find that the proposed eigenvectors are compatible with earlier experiments of the oxygen isotope effect as well as the replacement of Y by rare earth elements.},

In this work we present an isotope effect study of the excitation frequencies of two anharmonic potentials, the phi4 double-well and the Quadratic double-well (QDW) potentials, when the isotopic mass of the axial oxygen is varied.

abstract = {The effect of isotopic substitution in the excitation spectrum of a model polaronic system is presented. To study this effect we use a three-site many-body Hamiltonian, with two phonon modes, which includes electronic correlations and electron-phonon interactions. Under isotopic substitution, the shift of the lowest excitation energy changes sign for intermediate electron-phonon coupling, coinciding with the onset of polaronic behavior. This manifests as a strong change of the dynamics of polaron tunneling, a behavior opposite to that found in purely phonon excitations. Additionally, a small change in the static polaronic distortion appears under isotopic substitution. This change in the local structure has opposite signs for low and intermediate electron-phonon coupling compared to that found in the strong-coupling limit.},

This review covers these developments from a unified multiple-scattering viewpoint. The authors focus on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) well above an x-ray edge, and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) closer to an edge. The discussion includes both formal considerations, derived from a many-electron formulation, and practical computational methods based on independent-electron models, with many-body effects lumped into various inelastic losses and energy shifts. The main conceptual issues in XAFS theory are identified and their relative importance is assessed; these include the convergence of the multiple-scattering expansion, curved-wave effects, the scattering potential, inelastic losses, self-energy shifts, and vibrations and structural disorder. The advantages and limitations of current computational approaches are addressed, with particular regard to quantitative experimental comparisons.},

@article{Pan2001,
abstract = {The parent compounds of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors are unusual insulators (so-called Mott insulators). Superconductivity arises when they are 'doped' away from stoichiometry. For the compound Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, doping is achieved by adding extra oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers ('holes') into the CuO$_2$ planes where the superconductivity is believed to originate. Aside from providing the charge carriers, the role of the oxygen dopants is not well understood, nor is it clear how the charge carriers are distributed on the planes. Many models of high-T$_c$ superconductivity accordingly assume that the introduced carriers are distributed uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system as in ordinary metals. Here we report the presence of an electronic inhomogeneity in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, on the basis of observations using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. The inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variations in both the local density of states spectrum and the superconducting energy gap. These variations are correlated spatially and vary on the surprisingly short length scale of approximately 14 A. Our analysis suggests that this inhomogeneity is a consequence of proximity to a Mott insulator resulting in poor screening of the charge potentials associated with the oxygen ions left in the BiO plane after doping, and is indicative of the local nature of the superconducting state.},

abstract = {A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature T$_c$ (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at T$_c$ (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition.},

abstract = {All conventional metals are known to possess a three-dimensional Fermi surface, which is the locus in reciprocal space of the long-lived electronic excitations that govern their electronic properties at low temperatures. These excitations should have well-defined momenta with components in all three dimensions. The high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have unusual, highly two-dimensional properties above the superconducting transition. This, coupled with a lack of unambiguous evidence for a three-dimensional Fermi surface, has led to many new and exotic models for the underlying electronic ground state. Here we report the observation of polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations in the overdoped superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+delta in high magnetic fields, which firmly establishes the existence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface. Analysis of the oscillations reveals that at certain symmetry points, however, this surface is strictly two-dimensional. This striking form of the Fermi surface topography, long-predicted by electronic band structure calculations, provides a natural explanation for a wide range of anisotropic properties both in the normal and superconducting states. Our data reveal that, despite their extreme electrical anisotropy, the high-T(c) materials at high doping levels can be understood within a framework of conventional three-dimensional metal physics.},

For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors, it is far from clear that phonons are involved in the pairing at all. For example, the negligible change in T(c) of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212; ref. 1) upon oxygen isotope substitution (16O --> 18O leads to T(c) decreasing from 92 to 91 K) has often been taken to mean that phonons play an insignificant role in this material. Here we provide a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics of Bi2212 samples containing different oxygen isotopes, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data show definite and strong isotope effects. Surprisingly, the effects mainly appear in broad high-energy humps, commonly referred to as 'incoherent peaks'. As a function of temperature and electron momentum, the magnitude of the isotope effect closely correlates with the superconducting gap--that is, the pair binding energy. We suggest that these results can be explained in a dynamic spin-Peierls picture, where the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron-lattice coupling mutually enhance each other.},

Fits to the isolated Cu-O XAFS signal show the presence of a two-site radial distribution function, similar to that found in other La-based cuprate superconductors at temperatures below the temperature associated with the pseudogap appearance, T*. The appearance of the two-site distribution is interpreted as evidence of a non-homogeneous ground state, preceding the superconducting transition. Similar results found in other copper-oxide superconductors indicate that this non-homogeneous ground state is a general feature of these materials.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of a change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances on the dynamics of charge and ions on a three-site cluster, identified with an O–Cu–O cluster present in high temperature superconduc- tors.We consider amodel Hamiltonian that contains an elec- tronic part represented by a single band Hubbardmodel with onsite electronic correlations and a phononic part consisting of non-interacting Raman and infrared active phonons. The electron–phonon coupling is introduced through the change in interatomic distances generated by Coulomb repulsion between charges at neighbouring sites. For intermediate and strong values of the electron–phonon coupling, this model generates correlated electron–ion motion, i.e., polaron for- mation. In order to simulate the effect of change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances, we assume that the main effect such a change is a variation of the intersite elec- tron hopping probability, t . We, therefore, studied the exci- tation spectrum of this model and the local lattice distortion in the Cu–O bond length as a function of t . We also stud- ied the effect of a change in t in the polaron tunnelling en- ergy when we use different oxygen isotopicmasses, i.e.,O16 and O18.We find that as function of t , the isotopic shift does not show a monotonic behaviour, as it does as a function of the electron–phonon coupling constant. It exhibits a mini- mum for values of t forwhich the electron–phonon coupling generates local lattice distortions with magnitudes similar to those observed experimentally in high-temperature su- perconductors. This observation could be related with the observed maximum on T$_c$ as a function of the microstrain of the Cu–O bonds (Sanna et al. in Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 14(29–31), 2000; Bianconi et al. in J.

Although the correlation function exhibits a monotonic behavior as a function of the hole hopping parameter, and thus microstrain, its isotopic shift exhibits a maximum for specific values of t. This result suggests that if there is a coupling between polaronic objects and free carriers, coexisting in high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors, then this will manifest not only in the superconducting transition, but also on the properties directly related to the polaron formation in these materials.},

abstract = {The disposition of defects in metal oxides is a key attribute exploited for applications from fuel cells and catalysts to superconducting devices and memristors. The most typical defects are mobile excess oxygens and oxygen vacancies, which can be manipulated by a variety of thermal protocols as well as optical and d.c. electric fields. Here we report the X-ray writing of high-quality superconducting regions, derived from defect ordering, in the superoxygenated layered cuprate, La₂CuO(4+y). Irradiation of a poor superconductor prepared by rapid thermal quenching results first in the growth of ordered regions, with an enhancement of superconductivity becoming visible only after a waiting time, as is characteristic of other systems such as ferroelectrics, where strain must be accommodated for order to become extended. However, in La₂CuO(4+y), we are able to resolve all aspects of the growth of (oxygen) intercalant order, including an extraordinary excursion from low to high and back to low anisotropy of the ordered regions. We can also clearly associate the onset of high-quality superconductivity with defect ordering in two dimensions. Additional experiments with small beams demonstrate a photoresist-free, single-step strategy for writing functional materials.},

We observed the coincident, abrupt onset at T* of a particle-hole asymmetric antinodal gap in the electronic spectrum, a Kerr rotation in the reflected light polarization, and a change in the ultrafast relaxational dynamics, consistent with a phase transition. Upon further cooling, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity begin to grow close to the superconducting transition temperature (T$_c$), entangled in an energy-momentum-dependent manner with the preexisting pseudogap features, ushering in a ground state with coexisting orders.},

Gap and quasiparticle population dynamics revealed marked dependencies on both excitation density and crystal momentum. Close to the d-wave nodes, the superconducting gap was sensitive to the pump intensity, and Cooper pairs recombined slowly. Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.},

To lend support for this extended BCS theory, we derive the Fermi-Dirac statistics for Cooper-pair electrons, which correctly captures the physics of strongly bounded Cooper-pair break up with respect to changing temperature or superconductor gap (gap-BCS). Finally, we further extend the BCS formalism within the ionization energy theory to prove (iii) the existence of optimal doping that has maximum Tsc(x\_optimum) or gap-BCS (x\_optimum), and (iv) that the specific heat capacity jump at Tsc in cuprates is due to finite-temperature quantum phase transition. Along the way, we expose the precise microscopic reason why predicting (not guessing) a superconductor material properly is in general a hard problem within any theory that require pairing mechanism.},
