abstract = {We present exact diagonalization results of an electron-phonon model Hamiltonian for the O(4)-Cu(1)-O(4) cluster in YBa2Cu3O7. For large enough electron–infrared-phonon coupling the motion of holes and ions becomes strongly correlated, i.e., polaronic, leading to a double-well structure for the infrared mode, as encountered in x-ray-absorption fine structure. In contrast, the associated Raman mode shows a single-well behavior even for large electron–Raman-phonon coupling. The appearance of polarons accompanies nonadiabatic behavior yielding optical spectroscopy predictions differing from those obtained from harmonic or anharmonic lattice dynamics models.},

To study this effect we use a three-site many-body Hamiltonian, with two phonon modes, which includes electronic correlations and electron-phonon interactions. Under isotopic substitution, the shift of the lowest excitation energy changes sign for intermediate electron-phonon coupling, coinciding with the onset of polaronic behavior. This manifests as a strong change of the dynamics of polaron tunneling, a behavior opposite to that found in purely phonon excitations. Additionally, a small change in the static polaronic distortion appears under isotopic substitution. This change in the local structure has opposite signs for low and intermediate electron-phonon coupling compared to that found in the strong-coupling limit.},

abstract = {Using Raman spectroscopy and far-infrared ellipsometry we have investigated several YBa2Cu3O7 ceram- ics which were made from different isotopically pure Cu or Ba precursors. The observed shifts of Raman- and infrared-active phonons reveal insight into their relative Ba and Cu normal mode content. This allows us to examine mode eigenvectors obtained from lattice dynamical calculations. Our Raman results demonstrate that the 121 cm1 and 153 cm1 Ag phonons are only very weakly mixed and represent almost pure Ba and Cu vibrations, respectively, whereas they suggest considerable Ba-Cu-O mixing in the case of the B2g and B3g phonons at 140 cm1 and 142 cm1. The analysis of the infrared-active B1u modes yields a substantial contribution of Cu to the 150 cm1 and the 280 cm1 phonons and of Ba to the 150 cm1 mode. Making use of proposed eigenvectors, which are shown to be compatible with the observed isotope shifts, we determine effective charges for all ions from measured infrared oscillator strengths on a YBa2Cu3O7 crystal. We find that the proposed eigenvectors are compatible with earlier experiments of the oxygen isotope effect as well as the replacement of Y by rare earth elements.},

abstract = {Dramatic advances in the understanding of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) have been made over the past few decades, which have led ultimately to a highly quantitative theory. This review covers these developments from a unified multiple-scattering viewpoint. The authors focus on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) well above an x-ray edge, and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) closer to an edge. The discussion includes both formal considerations, derived from a many-electron formulation, and practical computational methods based on independent-electron models, with many-body effects lumped into various inelastic losses and energy shifts. The main conceptual issues in XAFS theory are identified and their relative importance is assessed; these include the convergence of the multiple-scattering expansion, curved-wave effects, the scattering potential, inelastic losses, self-energy shifts, and vibrations and structural disorder. The advantages and limitations of current computational approaches are addressed, with particular regard to quantitative experimental comparisons.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of a change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances on the dynamics of charge and ions on a three-site cluster, identified with an O–Cu–O cluster present in high temperature superconduc- tors.We consider amodel Hamiltonian that contains an elec- tronic part represented by a single band Hubbardmodel with onsite electronic correlations and a phononic part consisting of non-interacting Raman and infrared active phonons. The electron–phonon coupling is introduced through the change in interatomic distances generated by Coulomb repulsion between charges at neighbouring sites. For intermediate and strong values of the electron–phonon coupling, this model generates correlated electron–ion motion, i.e., polaron for- mation. In order to simulate the effect of change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances, we assume that the main effect such a change is a variation of the intersite elec- tron hopping probability, t . We, therefore, studied the exci- tation spectrum of this model and the local lattice distortion in the Cu–O bond length as a function of t . We also stud- ied the effect of a change in t in the polaron tunnelling en- ergy when we use different oxygen isotopicmasses, i.e.,O16 and O18.We find that as function of t , the isotopic shift does not show a monotonic behaviour, as it does as a function of the electron–phonon coupling constant. It exhibits a mini- mum for values of t forwhich the electron–phonon coupling generates local lattice distortions with magnitudes similar to those observed experimentally in high-temperature su- perconductors. This observation could be related with the observed maximum on Tc as a function of the microstrain of the Cu–O bonds (Sanna et al. in Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 14(29–31), 2000; Bianconi et al. in J.

abstract = {In conventional superconductors, the electron pairing that allows superconductivity is caused by exchange of virtual phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibration. For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors, it is far from clear that phonons are involved in the pairing at all. For example, the negligible change in T(c) of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212; ref. 1) upon oxygen isotope substitution (16O --> 18O leads to T(c) decreasing from 92 to 91 K) has often been taken to mean that phonons play an insignificant role in this material. Here we provide a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics of Bi2212 samples containing different oxygen isotopes, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data show definite and strong isotope effects. Surprisingly, the effects mainly appear in broad high-energy humps, commonly referred to as 'incoherent peaks'. As a function of temperature and electron momentum, the magnitude of the isotope effect closely correlates with the superconducting gap--that is, the pair binding energy. We suggest that these results can be explained in a dynamic spin-Peierls picture, where the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron-lattice coupling mutually enhance each other.},

@article{Kaminski2002,
abstract = {A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature Tc (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at Tc (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition.},

@article{Poccia2011,
abstract = {The disposition of defects in metal oxides is a key attribute exploited for applications from fuel cells and catalysts to superconducting devices and memristors. The most typical defects are mobile excess oxygens and oxygen vacancies, which can be manipulated by a variety of thermal protocols as well as optical and d.c. electric fields. Here we report the X-ray writing of high-quality superconducting regions, derived from defect ordering, in the superoxygenated layered cuprate, La₂CuO(4+y). Irradiation of a poor superconductor prepared by rapid thermal quenching results first in the growth of ordered regions, with an enhancement of superconductivity becoming visible only after a waiting time, as is characteristic of other systems such as ferroelectrics, where strain must be accommodated for order to become extended. However, in La₂CuO(4+y), we are able to resolve all aspects of the growth of (oxygen) intercalant order, including an extraordinary excursion from low to high and back to low anisotropy of the ordered regions. We can also clearly associate the onset of high-quality superconductivity with defect ordering in two dimensions. Additional experiments with small beams demonstrate a photoresist-free, single-step strategy for writing functional materials.},

@article{Conradson1990,
abstract = {Copper K-edge x-ray absorption data indicate that an axial oxygen-centered lattice instability accompanying the 93 K superconducting transition in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is of a pseudo-(anti)ferroelectric type, in that it appears to involve the softening of a double potential well into a structure in which the difference between the two copper-oxygen distances and the barrier height have both decreased. This softer structure is present only at temperatures within a fluctuation region around the transition. A similar process involving the analogous axial oxygen atom also accompanies the superconducting transition in T1Ba(2)Ca(3)Cu(4)O(11), where the superconducting transition temperature T(c) is \~{}120 K. The mean square relative displacement of this oxygen atom in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is also specifically affected by a reduction in the oxygen content and by the substitution of cobalt for copper, providing further evidence for the sensitivity of the displacement to additional factors that also influence the superconductivity. On the basis of the implied coupling of this ionic motion to the superconductivity, a scenario for high-temperature superconductivity is presented in which both phonon and electronic (charge transfer) channels are synergistically involved.},

abstract = {We present the results of the analysis of CuK-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) on Tl2Ba2CuO6, which show a complex Cu-O pair distribution function with multiple Cu-O bondlengths in the CuO2 planes, implying local phase separation in this material. Based on these results we propose a model of the local structure of these Tl-based superconductors. We present the formalism used to extract a pair distribution function from XAFS from a model interatomic potential, associating a dynamic time scale to fluctuations between different bond lengths. These copper-oxygen bondlengths are compared with those found in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+y , La1.85Sr0.15Cu2O4 and YBa2Cu3O7.},

abstract = {In-plane polarized Cu K-edge XAFS on La2CuO4.1 is presented, which indicates a radial in-plane Cu-O distribution function that is not a single Gaussian. Fits to the isolated Cu-O XAFS signal show the presence of a two-site radial distribution function, similar to that found in other La-based cuprate superconductors at temperatures below the temperature associated with the pseudogap appearance, T*. The appearance of the two-site distribution is interpreted as evidence of a non-homogeneous ground state, preceding the superconducting transition. Similar results found in other copper-oxide superconductors indicate that this non-homogeneous ground state is a general feature of these materials.},

abstract = {Introducing a unique method to study the atomic structure of nano-materials * Award winning research. Takeshi Egami received the 2003 Eugene Bertram Warren Diffraction Physics Award for the work described in the book. This book focuses on the structural determination of crystalline solids with extensive disorder. Well-established methods exist for characterizing the structure of fully crystalline solids or fully disordered materials such as liquids and glasses, but there is a dearth of techniques for the cases in-between, crystalline solids with internal atomic and nanometer scale disorder. Egami and Billinge discuss how to fill the gap using modern tools of structural characterization. While this subject might sound rather narrow, the fact is that today this problem is encountered in the structural characterization of a surprisingly wide range of complex materials of interest to modern technology and is becoming increasingly important.},

@article{Hussey2003,
abstract = {All conventional metals are known to possess a three-dimensional Fermi surface, which is the locus in reciprocal space of the long-lived electronic excitations that govern their electronic properties at low temperatures. These excitations should have well-defined momenta with components in all three dimensions. The high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have unusual, highly two-dimensional properties above the superconducting transition. This, coupled with a lack of unambiguous evidence for a three-dimensional Fermi surface, has led to many new and exotic models for the underlying electronic ground state. Here we report the observation of polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations in the overdoped superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+delta in high magnetic fields, which firmly establishes the existence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface. Analysis of the oscillations reveals that at certain symmetry points, however, this surface is strictly two-dimensional. This striking form of the Fermi surface topography, long-predicted by electronic band structure calculations, provides a natural explanation for a wide range of anisotropic properties both in the normal and superconducting states. Our data reveal that, despite their extreme electrical anisotropy, the high-T(c) materials at high doping levels can be understood within a framework of conventional three-dimensional metal physics.},

@article{Arulsamy2014,
abstract = {We systematically explore the exquisiteness of Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer(BCS) theory where the BCS-type electron-phonon interaction is unambiguously reinforced as the only viable superglue in cuprate superconductors because phonon-induced scattering is effectively nil for Cooper pairs (in its original form), and also phonons are never required to Bose-condense. Here, we prove that (i) the Cooper-pair binding energy can be strengthened to obtain high superconductor transition temperature (Tsc) and (ii) the existence of a generalized electron-phonon potential operator that can induce the finite-temperature quantum phase transition between superconducting and strange metallic phases. To lend support for this extended BCS theory, we derive the Fermi-Dirac statistics for Cooper-pair electrons, which correctly captures the physics of strongly bounded Cooper-pair break up with respect to changing temperature or superconductor gap (gap-BCS). Finally, we further extend the BCS formalism within the ionization energy theory to prove (iii) the existence of optimal doping that has maximum Tsc(x\_optimum) or gap-BCS (x\_optimum), and (iv) that the specific heat capacity jump at Tsc in cuprates is due to finite-temperature quantum phase transition. Along the way, we expose the precise microscopic reason why predicting (not guessing) a superconductor material properly is in general a hard problem within any theory that require pairing mechanism.},
