abstract = {The quantum information approach to many body physics has been very successful in giving new insight and novel numerical methods. In these lecture notes we take a vertical view of the subject, starting from general concepts and at each step delving into applications or consequences of a particular topic. We first review some general quantum information concepts like entanglement and entanglement measures, which leads us to entanglement area laws. We then continue with one of the most famous examples of area-law abiding states: matrix product states, and tensor product states in general. Of these, we choose one example (classical superposition states) to introduce recent developments on a novel quantum many body approach: quantum kinetic Ising models. We conclude with a brief outlook of the field.},

abstract = {Over two decades have passed since the discovery of superconductivity in LaCuO4 [1], inwhich CuO2 planes exist and for which, when it is doped with holes, the phenomenon is observed. Other cuprates have been found which contain the same CuO2 planes and show substantially higher transition temperatures, reaching 133 K at ambient pressure [2]. Electron doping is not addressed here because of limitations on space. It is a remarkable fact that in these 20 years since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity (HTS) no other class ofmaterials has been found which exhibits this property above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. With a view to finding another class, it would be rewarding to understand why these exceptional properties occur, which per se are regarded as among the important unsolved problems in present day physics. It is the intention of this article to sketch experimental and theoretical results which may lead to an understanding.},

abstract = {We present a systematic ab initio study based on density functional calculations to understand impurity effects in iron-based superconductors. Effective tight-binding Hamiltonians for the d bands of LaFeAsO with various transition-metal impurities such as Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Ru are constructed using maximally localizedWannier orbitals. Local electronic structures around the impurity are quantitatively characterized by their onsite potential and transfer hoppings to neighboring sites.We found that the impurities are classified into three groups according to the derived parameters: For Mn, Co, and Ni, their impurity 3d levels measured from the Fe 3d level are nearly, 0.3−0.3, and −0.8 eV, respectively, while, for the Zn case, the d level is considerably deep as −8eV. For the Ru case, although the onsite-level difference is much smaller as O(0.1) eV, the transfer integrals around the impurity site are larger than those of the pure system by 20\% ∼ 30\%, due to the large spatial spread of the Ru 4d orbitals.We also show that, while excess carriers are tightly trapped around the impurity site (due to the Friedel sum rule), there is a rigid shift of band structure near the Fermi level, which has the same effect as carrier doping.},

@article{Damascelli2004,
abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of solids. By measuring the kinetic energy and angular distribution of the electrons photoemitted from a sample illuminated with sufficiently high-energy radiation, one can gain information on both the energy and momentum of the electrons propagating inside a material. This is of vital importance in elucidating the connection between electronic, magnetic, and chemical structure of solids, in particular for those complex systems which cannot be appropriately described within the independent-particle picture. The last decade witnessed significant progress in this technique and its applications, thus ushering in a new era in photoelectron spectroscopy; today, ARPES experiments with 2meV energy resolution and 0.28 angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. In this paper we will review the fundamentals of the technique and present some illustrative experimental results; we will show how ARPES can probe the momentum-dependent electronic structure of solids providing detailed information on band dispersion and Fermi surface as well as on the strength and nature of many-body correlations, which may profoundly affect the one- electron excitation spectrum and in turn the macroscopic physical properties.},

A sharp superconducting transition is observed in low temperature resistivity and susceptibility, and susceptibility shows 100\% Meissner volume fraction for all crystals, while an antiferromagnetic transition is observed in susceptibility at Neel temperature (TN ) as high as 500 K to 540 K depending on A. It indicates the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism. A sharp increase in resistivity arises from the structural transition due to Fe vacancy ordering at the temperature slightly higher than TN. Occurrence of superconductivity in an antiferromagnetic ordered state with so high TN may suggest new physics in this type of unconventional superconductors.},

abstract = {The low-temperature antiferromagnetic state of the Sm-ions in both nonsuperconducting Sm- FeAsO and superconducting SmFeAsO0.9F0.1 single crystals was studied by magnetic torque, mag- netization, and magnetoresistance measurements in magnetic fields up to 60 T and temperatures down to 0.6 K. We uncover in both compounds a distinct rearrangement of the antiferromagneti- cally ordered Sm-moments near 35 − 40 T. This is seen in both, static and pulsed magnetic fields, as a sharp change in the sign of the magnetic torque, which is sensitive to the magnetic anisotropy and hence to the magnetic moment in the ab-plane, (i.e. the FeAs-layers), and as a jump in the magnetization for magnetic fields perpendicular to the conducting planes. This rearrangement of magnetic ordering in 35 − 40 T is essentially temperature independent and points towards a canted or a partially polarized magnetic state in high magnetic fields. However, the observed value for the saturation moment above this rearrangement, suggests that the complete suppression of the anti- ferromagnetism related to the Sm-moments would require fields in excess of 60 T. Such a large field value is particularly remarkable when compared to the relatively small N ́eel temperature TN ≃ 5 K, suggesting very anisotropic magnetic exchange couplings. At the transition, magnetoresistivity mea- surements show a crossover from positive to negative field-dependence, indicating that the charge carriers in the FeAs planes are sensitive to the magnetic configuration of the rare-earth elements. This is indicates a finite magnetic/electronic coupling between the SmO and the FeAs layers which are likely to mediate the exchange interactions leading to the long range antiferromagnetic order of the Sm ions.},

abstract = {Pressure dependence of electronic structures and spin states of iron-chalcogenide Fe1.01Se superconductors up to ∼66 GPa has been investigated with x-ray emission spectra and x-ray absorption spectra with partial-fluorescence yield. The intensity of the pre-edge peak at energy of ∼7112.7 eV of the Fe K-edge x-ray absorption spectrum of Fe1.01Se decreases progressively with pressure up to ∼10 GPa. A new prepeak at energy of ∼7113.7 eV develops for pressure above ∼13 GPa, indicating formation of a new phase. The experimental and the calculated Fe K-edge absorption spectra of Fe1.01Se using the FDMNES code agree satisfactorily. The larger compression accompanied by significant distortion around the Fe atoms along the c axis in Fe1.01Se upon applying pressure suppresses the Fe 3d-Se 4p and Fe 4p-Se 4d hybridization. The applied pressure suppresses the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic superexchange interaction and enhances spin fluctuations on the Fe sites in Fe1.01Se. A discontinuous variation of the integrated absolute difference values of the K$\beta$ emission line was observed, originating from a phase transition of Fe1.01Se for a pressure >12 GPa. Fe1.01Se shows a small net magnetic moment of Fe2+ at ambient pressure, probably arising from strong Fe-Fe spin fluctuations. The satellite line K$\beta$ was reduced in intensity upon applying pressure and became absent for pressure >52 GPa, indicating a continuous reduction of the spin moment of Fe in Fe1.01Se superconductors. The experimental results provide insight into the spin state of Fe1.01Se superconductors under pressure.},

abstract = {The electronic structure of superconducting Fe1.03Te0.94S0.06 has been studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Experimental band topography is compared to the calculations using the methods of Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) and the linearized augmented plane wave with local orbitals (LAPW+LO) method. The region of the $\Gamma$ point exhibits two hole pockets and a quasiparticle peak close to the chemical potential ($\mu$) with undetectable dispersion. This flat band with mainly dz(2) orbital character is most likely formed by the top of the outer hole pocket or is evidence of a third hole band. It may cover up to 3\% of the Brillouin zone volume and should give rise to a Van Hove singularity. Studies performed for various photon energies indicate that at least one of the hole pockets has a two-dimensional character. The apparently nondispersing peak at $\mu$ is clearly visible for 40 eV and higher photon energies, due to an effect of the photoionization cross-section rather than band dimensionality. Orbital characters calculated by LAPW+LO for stoichiometric FeTe do not reveal the flat dz(2) band but are in agreement with the experiment for the other dispersions around $\Gamma$ in Fe1.03Te0.94S0.06.},

The superstructure satellites are more pronounced in the neutron diffraction patterns suggesting that they can have some magnetic contribution. We have sorted out all possible symmetry adapted magnetic configurations and found that the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering with the ordered magnetic moment of Fe with ≃2$\mu$B does not contradict the experimental data. However, the solutions space is highly degenerate and we cannot choose a specific solution. Instead we propose possible magnetic configurations with the Fe magnetic moments in (ab) plane or along c axis. The superstructure is destroyed above Ts≃500 K by a first-order-like transition.},

A single oscillation is observed from gaseous water consistent with the location of the covalently bonded hydrogen in H 2O. The experimental phase and amplitude of the oscillation are in excellent agreement with curved wave multiple scattering calculations for isolated water molecules. With this determination of the O-H scattering phase shift we have quantified the covalent hydrogen bond distance (0.95+/-0.03 A) in liquid water, thus demonstrating that hydrogen EXAFS can become a valuable complement to existing structural methods in chemistry and biology.},

Fine structure in its phonon density of states as well as the Q dependence of excitations was revealed by means of a high-energy-resolution chopper spectrometer at a pulsed neutron source. The temperature dependence showed an anomalous behavior at Tc similar to critical phenomena, which could be due to a local distortion and an expansion of the dynamical correlation length. The distortion is associated with a 〈110〉 buckling structure, which is commonly observed in the orthorhombic phase of La2-xBaxCuO4 and in Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 in the superconducting state.},

abstract = {High-temperature superconductors with a Tc above 40 K have been found to be strongly correlated electron systems and to have a layered structure. Guided by these rules, Kamihara et al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 3296 (2008)] discovered a Tc up to 26 K in the layered La(O1−xFx)FeAs. By replacing La with trivalence rare-earth (RE) elements of smaller ionic radii, Tc has subsequently been raised to 41–52 K. Many theoretical models have been proposed that emphasize the important magnetic origin of superconductivity in this compound system and a possible further Tc enhancement in RE(O1−xFx)FeAs by compression. This later prediction appears to be supported by the pressure-induced Tc increase in La(O0.89F0.11)FeAs observed. Here we show that, in contrast to previous expectations, pressure can either suppress or enhance Tc, depending on the doping level, suggesting that a Tc exceeding 50 K may be found only in the yet-to-be discovered compound systems related to but different from RE(O1−xFx)FeAs and that the Tc of La(O1−xFx)FeAs and Sm(O1−xFx)FeAs may be further raised to about 50 K.},

@article{DelaCruz2008,
abstract = {Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron or hole doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures, and then, at approximately 137 K, develops long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.},

The superconducting transition temperature (TC) deceases linearly and the Meissner signal size also decreases with increasing pressure for SmFeAsO0.85. In contrast, the TC of PrFe0.925Co0.075AsO initially increases with pressure then saturates above ∼0.8 GPa. Meanwhile its Meissner signal exhibits the similar pressure dependence. Our results indicate that the pressure dependences of TC and superfluid density in both systems are positively correlated which suggests that these quaternary iron-based superconductors are not conventional BCS ones.},

Both crystals show ordered iron vacancy pattern and the crystal structure is well described in the I4/m space group with the lattice constants a =8.799, c =14.576 and a =8.730, c =14.115 ̊A and the refined stoichiometry x=0.30(1), y=0.83(2) and x=0.34(1), y=0.83(1) for Rb- and K-crystals respectively. The structure contains one fully occupied iron position and one almost empty vacancy position. Assuming that the iron moment is ordered only on the fully occupied site we have sorted out all eight irreducible representations (irreps) for the propagation vector k = 0 and have found that irreps $\tau$2 and $\tau$7 well fit the experimental data with the moments along c-axis. The moment amplitudes amounted to 2.15(3) $\mu$B, 2.55(3) $\mu$B for $\tau$2 and 2.08(6) $\mu$B, 2.57(3) $\mu$B for $\tau$7 for Rb- and K-crystals respectively. Irrep $\tau$2 corresponds to the Shubnikov group I4/m′ and gives a constant moment antiferromagnetic configuration, whereas $\tau$7 does not have Shubnikov counterpart and allows two different magnetic moments in the structure.},

All the compounds crystallize in the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure (space group = P4/nmm). The lattice parameters (a and c) decrease as expected on substitution of smaller phosphorus at the arsenic site in PrOFe0.9Co0.1As and a decrease in TC was observed on substitution of P ions at a low rate of 0.13 K/at.\% of P for x > 0.1. The irreversibility field (Hirr) and critical current density (JC), obtained using the AC susceptibility measurements, were found to decrease monotonically with increasing P concentration. Hirr is observed to be much smaller than HC2, pointing to a very low pinning energy. The pinning potential obtained using both in-field transport and AC susceptibility measurements indicates a low value of ∼40 meV and shows no significant variation with P substitution.},

The results validate the virtual crystal approximation for the electronic structure near the Fermi level. Its is found that the electronic density of states at the Fermi level is maximum for x=0.125, enhancing the electron-phonon interaction. An additional increase of the electron-phonon parameter \$\backslash lambda\$ is obtained if the coupling between the \$A\_\{1g\}\$ phonon and the Fe magnetic moment is included. It is found that the electron-phonon interaction can be one order of magnitude larger than its value if no spin resolution is included in the calculation.

abstract = {Copper K-edge x-ray absorption data indicate that an axial oxygen-centered lattice instability accompanying the 93 K superconducting transition in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is of a pseudo-(anti)ferroelectric type, in that it appears to involve the softening of a double potential well into a structure in which the difference between the two copper-oxygen distances and the barrier height have both decreased. This softer structure is present only at temperatures within a fluctuation region around the transition. A similar process involving the analogous axial oxygen atom also accompanies the superconducting transition in T1Ba(2)Ca(3)Cu(4)O(11), where the superconducting transition temperature T(c) is \~{}120 K. The mean square relative displacement of this oxygen atom in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is also specifically affected by a reduction in the oxygen content and by the substitution of cobalt for copper, providing further evidence for the sensitivity of the displacement to additional factors that also influence the superconductivity. On the basis of the implied coupling of this ionic motion to the superconductivity, a scenario for high-temperature superconductivity is presented in which both phonon and electronic (charge transfer) channels are synergistically involved.},

abstract = {'Quantum picturalism' is a method for graphically representing processes in quantum mechanics. It is of particular interest for quantum information processes, defining a 'flow' of information through a protocol or algorithm. In this paper we apply the category-theoretic work of Abramsky and Coecke to the topological cluster-state model of quantum computing to show the topological equivalence of defect strands in the cluster state and the graphical flow of the red/green calculus. We concentrate here on the pictorial representation, and use a minimal amount of the machinery of category theory. We give the equivalence between the graphical and topological information flows, and show the applicable rewrite algebra for this computing model. Finally we show how the use of quantum picturalism gives a proof algebra for topological cluster state computing, from which we can derive previously unknown properties of the model. This work not only demonstrates for the first time a concrete realisation of quantum diagrammatics, but also gives us a native graphical language for the design and analysis of topological quantum algorithms.},

@article{Gweon2004,
abstract = {In conventional superconductors, the electron pairing that allows superconductivity is caused by exchange of virtual phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibration. For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors, it is far from clear that phonons are involved in the pairing at all. For example, the negligible change in T(c) of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212; ref. 1) upon oxygen isotope substitution (16O --> 18O leads to T(c) decreasing from 92 to 91 K) has often been taken to mean that phonons play an insignificant role in this material. Here we provide a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics of Bi2212 samples containing different oxygen isotopes, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data show definite and strong isotope effects. Surprisingly, the effects mainly appear in broad high-energy humps, commonly referred to as 'incoherent peaks'. As a function of temperature and electron momentum, the magnitude of the isotope effect closely correlates with the superconducting gap--that is, the pair binding energy. We suggest that these results can be explained in a dynamic spin-Peierls picture, where the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron-lattice coupling mutually enhance each other.},

@article{Henn1997,
abstract = {Using Raman spectroscopy and far-infrared ellipsometry we have investigated several YBa2Cu3O7 ceram- ics which were made from different isotopically pure Cu or Ba precursors. The observed shifts of Raman- and infrared-active phonons reveal insight into their relative Ba and Cu normal mode content. This allows us to examine mode eigenvectors obtained from lattice dynamical calculations. Our Raman results demonstrate that the 121 cm1 and 153 cm1 Ag phonons are only very weakly mixed and represent almost pure Ba and Cu vibrations, respectively, whereas they suggest considerable Ba-Cu-O mixing in the case of the B2g and B3g phonons at 140 cm1 and 142 cm1. The analysis of the infrared-active B1u modes yields a substantial contribution of Cu to the 150 cm1 and the 280 cm1 phonons and of Ba to the 150 cm1 mode. Making use of proposed eigenvectors, which are shown to be compatible with the observed isotope shifts, we determine effective charges for all ions from measured infrared oscillator strengths on a YBa2Cu3O7 crystal. We find that the proposed eigenvectors are compatible with earlier experiments of the oxygen isotope effect as well as the replacement of Y by rare earth elements.},

Here we report the results of our experimental investigation of this compound, including determination of the crystal and magnetic structures using powder neutron diffraction, as well as measurements of electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefﬁcient, magnetization, and heat capacity. These results show that upon cooling a ferromagnetic state emerges near 69 K with a small saturation moment of 0.2B, likely on Co atoms. At 14 K the material enters an antiferromagnetic state with propagation vector 0 0 1/2 and small ordered moments 0.4B on Co and Nd. Near 3.5 K a third transition is observed, and corresponds to the antiferromagnetic ordering of larger moments on Nd, with the same propagation vector. The ordered moment on Nd reaches 1.395B at 300 mK. Anomalies in the magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity are observed at all three magnetic phase transitions.},

@article{Wu2013,
abstract = {The recent discovery of superconductivity at the interface of two non-superconducting materials has received much attention. In cuprate bilayers, the critical temperature (Tc) can be significantly enhanced compared with single-phase samples. Several explanations have been proposed, invoking Sr interdiffusion, accumulation and depletion of mobile charge carriers, elongation of the copper-to-apical-oxygen bond length, or a beneficial crosstalk between a material with a high pairing energy and another with a large phase stiffness. From each of these models, one would predict Tc to depend strongly on the carrier density in the constituent materials. Here, we study combinatorial libraries of La2-xSrxCuO4-La2CuO4 bilayer samples-an unprecedentedly large set of more than 800 different compositions. The doping level x spans a wide range, 0.15 < x < 0.47, and the measured Hall coefficient varies by one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, across the entire sample set, Tc stays essentially constant at about 40 K. We infer that doping up to the optimum level does not shift the chemical potential, unlike in ordinary Fermi liquids. This result poses a new challenge to theory-cuprate superconductors have not run out of surprises.},

For superconducting iron arsenides, in addition to the antiferromagnetic ground state, a small structural distortion breaks the crystal's C(4 )rotational symmetry in the underdoped part of the phase diagram. We reveal that the representative iron arsenide Ba(Fe(1)(-x)Co(x))(2)As(2) develops a large electronic anisotropy at this transition via measurements of the in-plane resistivity of detwinned single crystals, with the resistivity along the shorter b axis rho(b) being greater than rho(a). The anisotropy reaches a maximum value of \~{}2 for compositions in the neighborhood of the beginning of the superconducting dome. For temperatures well above the structural transition, uniaxial stress induces a resistivity anisotropy, indicating a substantial nematic susceptibility.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that the essential physics of high temperature superconducting copper oxides are governed by the properties of their antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Since these are Mott-Hubbard insulators being dominated by strong electronic correlations, continuations of this physics to the doped superconducting regime have been considered to be sufficient to describe the hole pairing mechanism. However, such a rather simplistic and na\"{\i}ve scenario cannot account for the complexity of the phase diagram and most importantly neglects the crucial effects stemming from the underlying lattice. It is shown here, that extensions of the Hubbard model (with the limiting case of the t-J model) including polaronic lattice effects yield a reasonable physical picture to describe the antiferromagnetic properties as well as the exotic isotope effects observed in the doped compounds. It is concluded that the most important lattice effects stem from a coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom to a JT Q2-type lattice distortion.},

abstract = {Cooper pairing between a conduction electron (\$c\$ electron) and an \$f\$ electron, referred to as the "\$c\$-\$f\$ pairing," is examined to explain s-wave superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems. We first apply the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to the periodic Anderson model assuming deep \$f\$ level and strong Coulomb repulsion. The resulting effective Hamiltonian contains direct and spin-exchange interactions between \$c\$ and \$f\$ electrons, which are responsible for the formation of the \$c\$-\$f\$ Cooper pairs. The mean-field analysis shows that the fully gapped \$c\$-\$f\$ pairing phase with anisotropic s-wave symmetry appears in a large region of the phase diagram. We also find two different types of exotic \$c\$-\$f\$ pairing phases, the Fulde-Ferrell and breached pairing phases. The formation of the \$c\$-\$f\$ Cooper pairs is attributed to the fact that the strong Coulomb repulsion makes a quasiparticle \$f\$ band near the center of the conduction band.},

@phdthesis{Hansen2008,
abstract = {The main topic of this thesis is how to approximate and compute spectra of linear operators on separable Hilbert spaces. We consider several approaches including the finite section method, an infinite-dimensional version of the QR algorithm, as well as pseudospec- tral techniques. Several new theorems about convergence of the finite section method (and variants of it) for self-adjoint problems are obtained together with a rigorous analy- sis of the infinite-dimensional QR algorithm for normal operators. To attack (and solve) the long standing general computational spectral problem we look to the pseudospectral theory and introduce the complexity index. A generalization of the pseudospectrum is introduced, namely, the n-pseudospectrum. This set behaves very much like the original pseudospectrum, but has the advantage that it approximates the spectrum well for large n. The complexity index is a tool for indicating how complex or difficult it may be to approximate spectra of operators belonging to a certain class. We establish bounds on the complexity index and discuss some open problems regarding this new mathematical entity. As the approximation framework also gives rise to several computational methods, we analyze and discuss implementation techniques for algorithms that can be derived from the theoretical model. In particular, we develop algorithms that can compute spectra of arbitrary bounded operators on separable Hilbert spaces, and the exposition is followed by several numerical examples. The thesis also contains a thorough discussion on how to implement the QR algorithm in infinite dimensions. This is supported by numerical computations. These examples reveal several surprisingly nice features of the infinite- dimensional QR algorithm, and this leaves a number of open problems that we debate. We also include a chapter on how the infinite-dimensional QR algorithm can be improved, in particular, how to speed it up. This approach is based on adapting the techniques used in finite dimensions to an infinite-dimensional setting.},

The appearance of the two-site distribution is interpreted as evidence of a non-homogeneous ground state, preceding the superconducting transition. Similar results found in other copper-oxide superconductors indicate that this non-homogeneous ground state is a general feature of these materials.},

abstract = {The effect of isotopic substitution in the excitation spectrum of a model polaronic system is presented. To study this effect we use a three-site many-body Hamiltonian, with two phonon modes, which includes electronic correlations and electron-phonon interactions. Under isotopic substitution, the shift of the lowest excitation energy changes sign for intermediate electron-phonon coupling, coinciding with the onset of polaronic behavior. This manifests as a strong change of the dynamics of polaron tunneling, a behavior opposite to that found in purely phonon excitations. Additionally, a small change in the static polaronic distortion appears under isotopic substitution. This change in the local structure has opposite signs for low and intermediate electron-phonon coupling compared to that found in the strong-coupling limit.},

Many experiments were carried out and theories formulated to try to understand the basic properties of these new materials and the mechanism for Tc. In this selective critical review of the experimental literature, we distill some of this extensive body of work, and discuss relationships between different types of experiments on these materials with reference to theoretical concepts and models. The experimental normal-state properties are emphasized, and within these the electronic and magnetic properties because of the likelihood of an electronic/magnetic mechanism for superconductivity in these materials.},

@article{Jorgensen1987,
abstract = {n situ neutron powder diffraction measurements show that the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition in YBa2Cu3O7-x, which occurs near 700°C in a pure oxygen atmosphere, is an order-disorder transition in which the disordering of oxygen atoms into a normally vacant site destroys the one-dimensional Cu-O chains present in the room-temperature orthorhombic structure. For both structures, the oxygen stoichiometry decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. The transition temperature depends on the oxygen partial pressure and occurs when the stoichiometry is near YBa2Cu3O6.5. The tetragonal structure has a partially occupied, nearly octahedral Cu-O arrangement, in contrast to the orthorhombic structure which has one-dimensional Cu-O chains. The observed depression of the superconducting transition temperature in tetragonal YBa2Cu3O7-x, which has been quenched from high temperature, could result either from the disordering of oxygen atoms which destroys the one-dimensional chains or from the absence of Cu3+ ions.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect that variations of the local microstrain have on the polaronic correlation function obtained from the exact diagonalization of a simple model Hamiltonian. Although the correlation function exhibits a monotonic behavior as a function of the hole hopping parameter, and thus microstrain, its isotopic shift exhibits a maximum for specific values of t. This result suggests that if there is a coupling between polaronic objects and free carriers, coexisting in high-Tc cuprate superconductors, then this will manifest not only in the superconducting transition, but also on the properties directly related to the polaron formation in these materials.},

abstract = {In this chapter we survey some particular topics in category theory in a somewhat unconventional manner. Our main focus will be on monoidal categories, mostly symmetric ones, for which we propose a physical interpretation. These are particularly relevant for quantum foundations and for quantum informatics. Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets, Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure, these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.},

abstract = {We review three different kinds of experiments that emphasize the non-BCS, inhomogeneous aspects of superconductivity in the high Tc cuprates. The first is the existence of two different energy scales in the superconducting state, initially identified by a comparison between tunneling and Andreev–Saint–James spectroscopies [Deutscher, Nature (London) 397, 410 (1999)]. The second are EXAFS measurements of the Cu-O bond length distribution, which have shown that below a temperature T*>Tc, it becomes broader than expected from the Debye-Waller broadening and presents a split [Bianconi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3412 (1996)]. The third one is the effect of frozen lattice disorder on critical current and vortex pinning, which profoundly affects the pairing landscape [Gutierrez et al., Nature Mater. 6, 367 (2007)]. We then discuss how these results fit with models in which the electron-lattice interaction plays a leading role.},

We analyze the model with the derived interactions together with the electronic repulsions within the random phase approximation. We find that the enhancement of the orbital fluctuations due to the electron-phonon interactions is small, making the spin fluctuations dominant. As a result, the superconducting state with the sign reversal in gap functions (\$s\_\backslash pm\$-wave) is realized.},

abstract = {Correlated electron fluids can exhibit a startling array of complex phases, among which one of the more surprising is the electron nematic, a translationally invariant metallic phase with a spontaneously generated spatial anisotropy. Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like molecules; given that electrons are point-like, the initial theoretical motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. That such phases exist in nature was established by dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007. In this paper, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature superconductors.},

Using atomic-resolution scanning-tunnelling microscopy (STM) to extract the spectrum of these modes in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+delta), Lee et al. find a mode whose frequency does not depend on doping but that changes on isotopic substitution of 16O with 18O. From this, they infer a role for lattice modes (phonons). However, examination of their data reveals a weaker, but distinct, feature that has all the characteristics of the magnetic excitation identified as the bosonic mode in other competing experiments. We therefore suggest that the lattice mode seen by Lee et al. is not relevant to superconductivity and is due to inelastic tunnelling through the insulating oxide layer.},

abstract = {While for many years the lattice, electronic and magnetic complexity of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has been considered responsible for hindering the search of the mechanism of HTS now the complexity of HTS is proposed to be essential for the quantum mechanism raising the superconducting critical temperature. The complexity is shown by the lattice heterogeneous architecture: a) heterostructures at atomic limit; b) electronic heterogeneity: multiple components in the normal phase; c) superconducting heterogeneity: multiple superconducting gaps in different points of the real space and of the momentum space. The complex phase separation forms an unconventional granular superconductor in a landscape of nanoscale superconducting striped droplets which is called the "superstripes" scenario. The interplay and competition between magnetic orbital charge and lattice fluctuations seems to be essential for the quantum mechanism that suppresses thermal decoherence effects at an optimum inhomogeneity.},

abstract = {Magnesium diboride, MgB2, was recently observed to become superconducting at 39 K, which is the highest known transition temperature for a non-copper-oxide bulk material. Isotope-effect measurements, in which atoms are substituted by isotopes of different mass to systematically change the phonon frequencies, are one of the fundamental tests of the nature of the superconducting mechanism in a material. In a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor, where the mechanism is mediated by electron-phonon coupling, the total isotope-effect coefficient (in this case, the sum of both the Mg and B coefficients) should be about 0.5. The boron isotope effect was previously shown to be large and that was sufficient to establish that MgB2 is a conventional superconductor, but the Mg effect has not hitherto been measured. Here we report the determination of the Mg isotope effect, which is small but measurable. The total reduced isotope-effect coefficient is 0.32, which is much lower than the value expected for a typical BCS superconductor. The low value could be due to complex materials properties, and would seem to require both a large electron-phonon coupling constant and a value of mu* (the repulsive electron-electron interaction) larger than found for most simple metals.},

abstract = {The seminal work by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) extended further by Eliashberg to the intermediate coupling regime solved one of the major scientific problems of Condensed Matter Physics in the last century. The BCS theory provides qualitative and in many cases quantitative descriptions of low-temperature superconducting metals and their alloys, and some novel high-temperature superconductors like magnesium diboride. The theory has been extended by us to the strong-coupling regime where carriers are small lattice polarons and bipolarons. Here I review the multi-polaron strong-coupling theory of superconductivity. Attractive electron correlations, prerequisite to any superconductivity, are caused by an almost unretarded electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction sufficient to overcome the direct Coulomb repulsion in this regime. Low energy physics is that of small polarons and bipolarons, which are real-space electron (hole) pairs dressed by phonons. They are itinerant quasiparticles existing in the Bloch states attemperatures below the characteristic phonon frequency. Since there is almost no retardation (i.e. no Tolmachev–Morel–Anderson logarithm) reducing the Coulomb repulsion, e-ph interactions should be relatively strong to overcome the direct Coulomb repulsion, so carriers mustbe polaronic to form pairs in novel superconductors. I identify the long-range Fr\"{o}hlich electron-phonon interaction as the most essential for pairing in superconducting cuprates. A number of key observations have been predicted or explained with polarons and bipolarons including unusual isotope effects and upper critical fields, normal state (pseudo)gaps and kinetic properties, normal state diamagnetism, and giant proximity effects. These and many other observations provide strong evidence for a novel state of electronic matter in layered cuprates, which is a charged Bose-liquid of small mobile bipolarons.},

abstract = {In the light of the tremendous progress that has been made in raising the transition temperature of the copper oxide superconductors (for a review, see ref. 1), it is natural to wonder how high the transition temperature, Tc, can be pushed in other classes of materials. At present, the highest reported values of Tc for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity are 33 K in electron-doped Cs(x)Rb(y)C60 (ref. 2), and 30 K in Ba(1-x)K(x)BiO3 (ref. 3). (Hole-doped C60 was recently found to be superconducting with a Tc as high as 52 K, although the nature of the experiment meant that the supercurrents were confined to the surface of the C60 crystal, rather than probing the bulk.) Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in magnesium diboride, MgB2. Magnetization and resistivity measurements establish a transition temperature of 39 K, which we believe to be the highest yet determined for a non-copper-oxide bulk superconductor.},

@article{Stewart2011,
abstract = {Kamihara and coworkers' report of superconductivity at Tc = 26 K in fluorine-doped LaFeAsO inspired a worldwide effort to understand the nature of the superconductivity in this new class of compounds. These iron pnictide and chalcogenide (FePn/Ch) superconductors have Fe electrons at the Fermi surface, plus an unusual Fermiology that can change rapidly with doping, which lead to normal and superconducting state properties very different from those in standard electron-phonon coupled 'conventional' superconductors. Clearly superconductivity and magnetism/magnetic fluctuations are intimately related in the FePn/Ch - and even coexist in some. Open questions, including the superconducting nodal structure in a number of compounds, abound and are often dependent on improved sample quality for their solution. With Tc values up to 56 K, the six distinct Fe-containing superconducting structures exhibit complex but often comparable behaviors. The search for correlations and explanations in this fascinating field of research would benefit from an organization of the large, seemingly disparate data set. This review attempts to provide an overview, using numerous references, with a focus on the materials and their superconductivity.},

abstract = {Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity. The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.},

This article provides an efficient introduction to Francis’s algorithm that follows a novel path. Efficiency is gained by omitting the traditional but wholly unnecessary detour through the basic QR algorithm. A brief history of the algorithm is also included. It was not a one-man show; some other important names are Rutishauser, Wilkinson, and Kublanovskaya. Francis was never a specialist in matrix computations. He was employed in the early computer indus- try, spent some time on the problem of eigenvalue computation and did amazing work, and then moved on to other things. He never looked back, and he remained unaware of the huge impact of his work until many years later.},

We use neutron scattering to study the structural and magnetic phase transitions in CeFeAsO(1-x)F(x) as the system is tuned from a semimetal to a high-Tc superconductor through fluorine (F) doping, x. In the undoped state, CeFeAsO develops a structural lattice distortion followed by a collinear antiferromagnetic order with decreasing temperature. With increasing fluorine doping, the structural phase transition decreases gradually and vanishes within the superconductivity dome near x=0.10, whereas the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed before the appearance of superconductivity for x>0.06, resulting in an electronic phase diagram remarkably similar to that of the high-Tc copper oxides. Comparison of the structural evolution of CeFeAsO(1-x)F(x) with other Fe-based superconductors suggests that the structural perfection of the Fe-As tetrahedron is important for the high-Tc superconductivity in these Fe pnictides.},

(ii) To axiomatise complementarity of quantum observables within a general framework for physical theories in terms of dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We also axiomatize phase shifts within this framework. Using the well-studied canonical correspondence between graphical calculi and symmetric monoidal categories, our results provide a purely graphical formalisation of complementarity for quantum observables. Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group. We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.},

It is shown that, as a consequence of our result, such a class of nonlocal games is able to witness quantum entanglement, however weak, and reveal nonlocality in any entangled quantum state. An example illustrating this fact is provided.},

abstract = {Formation of electron pairs is essential to superconductivity. For conventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established that pairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivative of tunnel current d2I/dV2 corresponds to each phonon mode. For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductivity, however, no boson mediating electron pairing has been identified. One explanation could be that electron pair formation and related electron-boson interactions are heterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize. However, with the latest advances in d2I/dV2 spectroscopy using scanning tunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directly at the atomic scale. Here we report d2I/dV2 imaging studies of the high-T(c) superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We find intense disorder of electron-boson interaction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expected modulations in d2I/dV2 (refs 9, 10). Changing the density of holes has minimal effects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating that the bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. Instead, the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of 18O for 16O throughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 per cent--the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibration frequencies. Significantly, the mode energies are always spatially anticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting an interplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity.},

abstract = {As experimentally well established, undoped LaFeAsO is antiferromagnetic below 137K with the magnetic moments lying on the Fe sites. We determine the orthorhombic body-centered group Imma (74) as the space group of the experimentally observed magnetic structure in the undistorted lattice, i.e., in a lattice possessing no structural distortions in addition to the magnetostriction. We show that LaFeAsO possesses a partly filled "magnetic band" with Bloch functions that can be unitarily transformed into optimally localized Wannier functions adapted to the space group Imma. This finding is interpreted in the framework of a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism, the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model. Within this model, however, the magnetic structure with the space group Imma is not stable but can be stabilized by a (slight) distortion of the crystal turning the space group Imma into the space group Pnn2 (34). This group-theoretical result is in accordance with the experimentally observed displacements of the Fe and O atoms in LaFeAsO as reported by Clarina de la Cruz et al. [nature 453, 899 (2008)].},

@article{Bussmann-Holder2012,
abstract = {In this review we consider three classes of superconductors, namely cuprate superconductors, MgB(2) and the new Fe based superconductors. All of these three systems are layered materials and multiband compounds. Their pairing mechanisms are under discussion with the exception of MgB(2), which is widely accepted to be a 'conventional' electron-phonon interaction mediated superconductor, but extending the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory to account for multiband effects. Cuprates and Fe based superconductors have higher superconducting transition temperatures and more complex structures. Superconductivity is doping dependent in these material classes unlike in MgB(2) which, as a pure compound, has the highest values of T(c) and a rapid suppression of superconductivity with doping takes place. In all three material classes isotope effects have been observed, including exotic ones in the cuprates, and controversial ones in the Fe based materials. Before the area of high-temperature superconductivity, isotope effects on T(c) were the signature for phonon mediated superconductivity-even when deviations from the BCS value to smaller values were observed. Since the discovery of high T(c) materials this is no longer evident since competing mechanisms might exist and other mediating pairing interactions are discussed which are of purely electronic origin. In this work we will compare the three different material classes and especially discuss the experimentally observed isotope effects of all three systems and present a rather general analysis of them. Furthermore, we will concentrate on multiband signatures which are not generally accepted in cuprates even though they are manifest in various experiments, the evidence for those in MgB(2), and indications for them in the Fe based compounds. Mostly we will consider experimental data, but when possible also discuss theoretical models which are suited to explain the data.},

abstract = {The model of two (s and p) channel superconductivity known to be necessary to explain the superconductivity of MgB2 has been applied to the Al1-xMgxB2 diborides by tuning x from MgB2 to AlMgB4. The interband coupling paramenter (probing the strength of the interchannel pairing due to quantum interferences effects) and the two gaps in the s and p channel have been calculated as a function of x by using experimental data for the two phonon mode energies which are most relevant for the pairing interaction. It is found that the two gaps reverse in leading order around x=0.6 and that in comparison with the dominant intra-s-band single channel pairing an increase in Tc of 1.5 occurs for MgB2 while in AlMgB4 the dominant p band sigle channel pairing leads to enhancement of Tc of 100.},

@article{Choi2002,
abstract = {Magnesium diboride differs from ordinary metallic superconductors in several important ways, including the failure of conventional models to predict accurately its unusually high transition temperature, the effects of isotope substitution on the critical transition temperature, and its anomalous specific heat. A detailed examination of the energy associated with the formation of charge-carrying pairs, referred to as the 'superconducting energy gap', should clarify why MgB(2) is different. Some early experimental studies have indicated that MgB(2) has multiple gaps, but past theoretical studies have not explained from first principles the origin of these gaps and their effects. Here we report an ab initio calculation of the superconducting gaps in MgB(2) and their effects on measurable quantities. An important feature is that the electronic states dominated by orbitals in the boron plane couple strongly to specific phonon modes, making pair formation favourable. This explains the high transition temperature, the anomalous structure in the specific heat, and the existence of multiple gaps in this material. Our analysis suggests comparable or higher transition temperatures may result in layered materials based on B, C and N with partially filled planar orbitals.},

@article{Hu2012,
abstract = {Although iron-based superconductors are multiorbital systems with complicated band structures, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics which is responsible for their high-Tc superconductivity is essentially governed by an effective two-orbital Hamiltonian near half filling. This underlying electronic structure is protected by the S4 symmetry. With repulsive or strong next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, the model results in a robust A1g s-wave pairing which can be mapped exactly to the d-wave pairing observed in cuprates. The classification of the super- conducting (SC) states according to the S4 symmetry leads to a natural prediction of the existence of two different phases, named the A and B phases. In the B phase, the superconducting order has an overall sign change along the c axis between the top and bottom As (or Se) planes in a single Fe-As (or Fe-Se) trilayer structure, the common building block of iron-based superconductors. The sign change is analogous to the sign change in the d-wave superconducting state of cuprates upon 90 rotation. Our derivation provides a unified understanding of iron pnictides and iron chalcogenides, and suggests that cuprates and iron-based superconductors share an identical high-Tc superconducting mechanism.},

abstract = {In this study, we performed high-pressure electrical resistivity measurements of polycrystalline FeSe in the pressure range of 1–16.0 GPa at temperatures of 4–300 K. A precise evaluation of Tc from zero-resistivity temperatures revealed that Tc shows a slightly distorted dome-shaped curve with maximum Tcoffset (30 K) at 6 GPa. With the application of pressure, the temperature dependence of resistivity above Tc changes dramatically to a linear dependence, that the high-Tc phase appears above 3 GPa. We found a striking correlation between Tc and the Se height: the lower the Se height, the more enhanced is Tc. Moreover, this relation is broadly applicable to other iron pnictides, strongly indicating that high-temperature superconductivity can appear only around the optimum anion height (∼1.38 \AA). On the basis of these results, we suggest that the anion height should be considered as a key determining factor of Tc of iron-based superconductors containing various anions.},

abstract = {The superconducting transition temperature of the high-Tc SmO1-xFxFeAs superconductors increases monotonically as the F-doping level x increases to 0.20. High-pressure magnetization experiments reveal a strong sensitivity of Tc to interatomic distances in the underdoped regime (x ≤ 0.12) with the pressure coefficient of Tc, d(lnTc)/dP being strongly positive. However, as the doping level increases further to x = 0.15, we find that this sensitivity is strongly suppressed and at the same time, d(lnTc)/dP sharply switches over to assume negative values with Tc decreasing with increasing applied pressure. The abrupt change in the pressure response of the superconducting properties of the SmO1-xFxFeAs phases coincides with the putative existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near x ≈ 0.14, as proposed by resistivity and Hall effect measurements.},

@article{Telesca2012,
abstract = {We report on the local electronic structure of oxygen incorporated FeTe and FeSe films and how this relates to superconductivity observed in these films. In the case of FeTe, initially grown films are measured to be nonsuperconducting, but become superconducting following oxygen incorporation. In FeSe the opposite happens; initially grown films are measured to be superconducting, but experience a quenching of superconductivity following oxygen incorporation. X-ray photoemission and total fluorescence yield (TFY) x-ray absorption experiments show that oxygen incorporation changes the initial Fe valence state in both the as grown FeTe and FeSe films to mainly Fe3+ in the oxygen incorporated films. In contrast we observe that while Te moves to a mixed Te0/Te4+ valence state, the Se always remains Se0. This work highlights how different responses of the electronic structure by the respective chalcogenides to oxidation could be related to the mechanisms which are inducing superconductivity in FeTe and quenching superconductivity in FeSe.},

Takeshi Egami received the 2003 Eugene Bertram Warren Diffraction Physics Award for the work described in the book. This book focuses on the structural determination of crystalline solids with extensive disorder. Well-established methods exist for characterizing the structure of fully crystalline solids or fully disordered materials such as liquids and glasses, but there is a dearth of techniques for the cases in-between, crystalline solids with internal atomic and nanometer scale disorder. Egami and Billinge discuss how to fill the gap using modern tools of structural characterization. While this subject might sound rather narrow, the fact is that today this problem is encountered in the structural characterization of a surprisingly wide range of complex materials of interest to modern technology and is becoming increasingly important.},

@article{Hussey2003,
abstract = {All conventional metals are known to possess a three-dimensional Fermi surface, which is the locus in reciprocal space of the long-lived electronic excitations that govern their electronic properties at low temperatures. These excitations should have well-defined momenta with components in all three dimensions. The high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have unusual, highly two-dimensional properties above the superconducting transition. This, coupled with a lack of unambiguous evidence for a three-dimensional Fermi surface, has led to many new and exotic models for the underlying electronic ground state. Here we report the observation of polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations in the overdoped superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+delta in high magnetic fields, which firmly establishes the existence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface. Analysis of the oscillations reveals that at certain symmetry points, however, this surface is strictly two-dimensional. This striking form of the Fermi surface topography, long-predicted by electronic band structure calculations, provides a natural explanation for a wide range of anisotropic properties both in the normal and superconducting states. Our data reveal that, despite their extreme electrical anisotropy, the high-T(c) materials at high doping levels can be understood within a framework of conventional three-dimensional metal physics.},

@article{Kaminski2002,
abstract = {A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature Tc (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at Tc (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of a change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances on the dynamics of charge and ions on a three-site cluster, identified with an O–Cu–O cluster present in high temperature superconduc- tors.We consider amodel Hamiltonian that contains an elec- tronic part represented by a single band Hubbardmodel with onsite electronic correlations and a phononic part consisting of non-interacting Raman and infrared active phonons. The electron–phonon coupling is introduced through the change in interatomic distances generated by Coulomb repulsion between charges at neighbouring sites. For intermediate and strong values of the electron–phonon coupling, this model generates correlated electron–ion motion, i.e., polaron for- mation. In order to simulate the effect of change in the equilibrium nearest neighbour distances, we assume that the main effect such a change is a variation of the intersite elec- tron hopping probability, t . We, therefore, studied the exci- tation spectrum of this model and the local lattice distortion in the Cu–O bond length as a function of t . We also stud- ied the effect of a change in t in the polaron tunnelling en- ergy when we use different oxygen isotopicmasses, i.e.,O16 and O18.We find that as function of t , the isotopic shift does not show a monotonic behaviour, as it does as a function of the electron–phonon coupling constant. It exhibits a mini- mum for values of t forwhich the electron–phonon coupling generates local lattice distortions with magnitudes similar to those observed experimentally in high-temperature su- perconductors. This observation could be related with the observed maximum on Tc as a function of the microstrain of the Cu–O bonds (Sanna et al. in Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 14(29–31), 2000; Bianconi et al. in J.

If coupling is strong enough for one or more bands, polaronic effects practically decou- ple these bands from the rest. Single ions being dressed by strong e-ph interactions move in the local potentials having two ormoreminima, and hence, can be viewed as the system of the Ising spins. Intersite interactions via the RKKY-type exchange by the electron-hole pairs tend to order the lat- ter thus providing the CDW instability mechanism with a structural vector, Q that has nothing in common with the Fermi surfaces parameters. Among the most typical man- ifestations of such strong e-ph coupling in the system are large characteristic energy scales significantly exceeding the temperatures for the onset of the CDWphase.

abstract = {The Hall coefficient R\_H of the cuprate superconductor YBa\_2Cu\_3O\_y was measured in magnetic fields up to 60 T for a hole concentration p from 0.078 to 0.152 in the underdoped regime. In fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, R\_H(T) is seen to go from positive at high temperature to negative at low temperature, for p>0.08. This change of sign is attributed to the emergence of an electron pocket in the Fermi surface at low temperature. At p<0.08, the normal-state R\_H(T) remains positive at all temperatures, increasing monotonically as T→0. We attribute the change of behavior across p=0.08 to a Lifshitz transition, namely a change in Fermi-surface topology occurring at a critical concentration p\_L=0.08, where the electron pocket vanishes. The loss of the high-mobility electron pocket across p\_L coincides with a tenfold drop in the conductivity at low temperature, revealed in measurements of the electrical resistivity $\rho$ at high fields, showing that the so-called metal-insulator crossover of cuprates is in fact driven by a Lifshitz transition. It also coincides with a jump in the in-plane anisotropy of $\rho$, showing that without its electron pocket, the Fermi surface must have strong twofold in-plane anisotropy. These findings are consistent with a Fermi-surface reconstruction caused by a unidirectional spin-density wave or stripe order.},

abstract = {We investigate a model for the CuO2 plane of high-Tc superconductors where the charge carriers are coupled to A1g andB1g symmetric out-of plane vibrations of the oxygen atoms in the presence of local Hubbard correlations. The coupling is implemented via a modulation of the hopping integral and we calculate the renormalization of vertex and pairing scattering functions based on the time-dependent Gutziller approximation. Contrary to local electron-phonon couplings we find that the transitive coupling can even be enhanced by correlations for certain momenta and symmetries of the vibrations. While this effect may be important for certain properties, we find that, with regard to superconductivity, electron-electron correlations still generically lead to a suppression of the pairing correlations. Our results allow for an estimate of correlation effects on the electron-phonon induced pair scattering from weak electron-electron interactions up to theMott regime. For onsite repulsions relevant to cuprate superconductors our calculations reveal a significant contribution of B1g phonons to d-wave superconductivity.},

abstract = {CeCoIn5 is a heavy fermion superconductor with strong similarities to the high-Tc cuprates, including quasi-two-dimensionality, proximity to antiferromagnetism and probable d-wave pairing arising from a non-Fermi-liquid normal state. Experiments allowing detailed comparisons of their electronic properties are of particular interest, but in most cases are difficult to realize, due to their very different transition temperatures. Here we use low-temperature microwave spectroscopy to study the charge dynamics of the CeCoIn5 superconducting state. The similarities to cuprates, in particular to ultra-clean YBa2Cu3Oy, are striking: the frequency and temperature dependence of the quasiparticle conductivity are instantly recognizable, a consequence of rapid suppression of quasiparticle scattering below Tc; and penetration-depth data, when properly treated, reveal a clean, linear temperature dependence of the quasiparticle contribution to superfluid density. The measurements also expose key differences, including prominent multiband effects and a temperature-dependent renormalization of the quasiparticle mass.},

abstract = {Dramatic advances in the understanding of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) have been made over the past few decades, which have led ultimately to a highly quantitative theory. This review covers these developments from a unified multiple-scattering viewpoint. The authors focus on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) well above an x-ray edge, and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) closer to an edge. The discussion includes both formal considerations, derived from a many-electron formulation, and practical computational methods based on independent-electron models, with many-body effects lumped into various inelastic losses and energy shifts. The main conceptual issues in XAFS theory are identified and their relative importance is assessed; these include the convergence of the multiple-scattering expansion, curved-wave effects, the scattering potential, inelastic losses, self-energy shifts, and vibrations and structural disorder. The advantages and limitations of current computational approaches are addressed, with particular regard to quantitative experimental comparisons.},

abstract = {The iron- and nickel-based layered compounds LaOFeP (refs 1, 2) and LaONiP (ref. 3) have recently been reported to exhibit low-temperature superconducting phases with transition temperatures Tc of 3 and 5 K, respectively. Furthermore, a large increase in the midpoint Tc of up to 26 K has been realized4 in the isocrystalline compound LaOFeAs on doping of fluoride ions at the O2- sites (LaO1-xFxFeAs). Experimental observations5, 6 and theoretical studies7, 8, 9 suggest that these transitions are related to a magnetic instability, as is the case for most superconductors based on transition metals. In the copper-based high-temperature superconductors, as well as in LaOFeAs, an increase in Tc is often observed as a result of carrier doping in the two-dimensional electronic structure through ion substitution in the surrounding insulating layers, suggesting that the application of external pressure should further increase Tc by enhancing charge transfer between the insulating and conducting layers. The effects of pressure on these iron oxypnictide superconductors may be more prominent than those in the copper-based systems, because the As ion has a greater electronic polarizability, owing to the covalency of the Fe–As chemical bond, and, thus, is more compressible than the divalent O2- ion. Here we report that increasing the pressure causes a steep increase in the onset Tc of F-doped LaOFeAs, to a maximum of 43 K at 4 GPa. With the exception of the copper-based high-Tc superconductors, this is the highest Tc reported to date. The present result, together with the great freedom available in selecting the constituents of isocrystalline materials with the general formula LnOTMPn (Ln, Y or rare-earth metal; TM, transition metal; Pn, group-V, 'pnicogen', element), indicates that the layered iron oxypnictides are promising as a new material platform for further exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.},

abstract = {We have investigated the dependence of the oxygen isotope effect on the hole density in the high-Tc cuprates Bi2Sr2CaCu2Os and YBa:Cu\~{}Os. The hole density n was varied by partial replacement of Ca by Y (hole acceptor) in BizSr2CaCu2Os, and by partial replacement of Y by Ca (hole donor) in YBa2Cu4Os. In both cases the dopant was introduco.d into the eightfold coordi- nated site between the two CuO2 sheets. The hole concentration could be varied to reach maximum Tc and upon further doping Tc decreased. The oxygen isotope effect ao was found to be strongly correlated to n and Tc. When n is optimized to give maximum Tc, ao is very small, dose to zero and ao increases rapidly when n is either less than or greater than the optimum.},

abstract = {The conditions leading to small-polaron formation for a single charge carrier in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model are compared with the Holstein model. From analytic perturbation theory and exact numerical diagonalization of small clusters different criteria are established, which however have a common physical origin: Polaron formation requires a sizable mass enhancement and a lattice deformation energy gain larger than the loss in the bare electron kinetic energy in both models. The optical absorption of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the polaronic regime is also shown to exhibit an additional feature not present in the Holstein model. This additional feature arises due to the bond nature of small polarons in the SSH model, and is determined by transitions from the ground state of the bonding character on a shortened bond to excited states of the antibonding character on the same shortened bond.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-FeSe with the PbO structure is a key member of the family of high-Tc iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors, as while it possesses the basic layered structural motif of edge-sharing distorted FeSe4 tetrahedra, it lacks interleaved ion spacers or charge-reservoir layers. We find that the application of hydrostatic pressure first rapidly increases Tc which attains a broad maximum of 37 K at ∼7 GPa before decreasing to 6 K upon further compression to ∼14 GPa. Complementary synchrotron x-ray diffraction at 16 K was used to measure the low-temperature isothermal compressibility of $\alpha$-FeSe, revealing an extremely soft solid with a bulk modulus, K0=30.7(1.1) GPa and strong bonding anisotropy between interlayer and intralayer directions that transforms to the more densely packed $\beta$ polymorph above ∼9 GPa. The nonmonotonic Tc(P) behavior of FeSe coincides with drastic anomalies in the pressure evolution of the interlayer spacing, pointing to the key role of this structural feature in modulating the electronic properties.},

The underdoped compound with the initial \$T\_c\$ of 65 K has been studied as a function of pressure up to 20 GPa by magnetic susceptibility and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The linear increase in \$T\_c\$ with pressure is the same as previously been found for the optimally-doped compound.

Hg1201 can have almost identical CuO\$\_6\$ octahedra as LSCO if specifically strained. When the apical and in-plane CuO\$\_2\$ distances are the same for the two compounds, the large discrepancy in their \$T\_c\$ cannot be explained by current theory, leading to the conclusion that interactions in the Hg-O charge-reservoir layers are likely to be responsible for the enhanced \$T\_c\$ in Hg1201.},

In addition to the strong electron correlation, the inclusion of phonons provides a theoretical framework explaining many important phenomena that cannot be understood by a strongly correlated electronic model alone. In particular, it is indispensable to explain the difference among materials. The phonons with the wavenumber around the (0, qy ) and (qx , 0) axes create d-wave pairing while that near ($\pi$, $\pi$) are pair breaking. Therefore the half-breathing mode of the oxygen motions helps d-wave superconductivity.},

By proposing a proper second quantization for the non-Hermitian in the polarization-vector space, we obtain a new heat current density operator with two separate contributions: the normal velocity responsible for the longitudinal phonon transport, and the anomalous velocity manifesting itself as the Hall effect of transverse phonon transport. As exemplified in kagome lattices, our theory predicts that the direction of Hall conductivity at low magnetic field can be reversed by tuning the temperatures, which we hope can be verified by experiments in the future. Three phonon-Hall-conductivity singularities induced by phonon-band-topology change are discovered as well, which correspond to the degeneracies at three different symmetric center points, $\Gamma$, K, X, in the wavevector space of the kagome lattice.},

To this means we define strongly compact closed categories which abstractly capture the behavioral properties of quantum entanglement. (2) `Postulates for an abstract quantum formalism' in which classical information-flow (e.g. token exchange) is part of the formalism. As an example, we provide a purely formal description of quantum teleportation and prove correctness in abstract generality. In this formalism types reflect kinds, contra the essentially typeless von Neumann formalism. Hence even concretely this formalism manifestly improves on the usual one.

abstract = {Measurements of the Fe K-edge x-ray absorption near edge (XANES) spectra of LnOFeAs (Ln being a lanthanide) high Tc superconductors exhibit significant changes in the pre-edge peak region upon rare earth substitution. Ab initio XANES calculations, based on the local structure centered at the Fe site obtained by crystallographic investigations, reproduce the observed changes in the spectra, indicating variations of the Fe d-local unoccupied electronic states. The calculated Fe density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy shows an increase of the Fe d-density of states with increasing height of the arsenic atomic position with respect to the iron plane, similar to that observed for the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. These calculations show that not only the atomic position variation of the Fe-As layers induced by the rare earth substitution is relevant in the increase of the DOS at the Fermi-level, but the actual change in electronic configuration of the rare earth also plays a role in the increase of Fe d-density of states at the Fermi energy.},

abstract = {The original CA 125 serum tumor marker test is a homologous double-determinant (OC 125 monoclonal antibody based) assay for the quantification of tumor associated mucin-like CA 125 molecules present in the serum. Commercial kits, now supplied by various manufacturers (and in different versions, e.g. IRMA, EIA, etc.) are currently widely applied in the following clinical situations: (i) Monitoring of disease. Doubling or halving of CA 125 serum values correlated (in 87\% of all cases) with tumor progression or regression, respectively. (ii) Early prediction of outcome. Deviation from the ideal CA 125 regression curve predicts poor outcome within 3 months of cytostatic treatment. (iii) Tumor status after completion of therapy. Patients with CA 125 > 35 U/ml have (in 95\% of all cases) still tumor present (at second look surgery). However, patients with CA 125 < 35 U/ml have in 50\% (mostly minimal) residual disease. (iv) Early detection of recurrence. After a complete remission, a rise in CA 125 precedes tumor recurrence in 75\% of all patients, with lead times up to more then 1 year, surpassing the CT-scan in cheapness and accuracy. (v) Diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Only when used in combination with other markers, do CA 125 determinations have a value as a diagnostic adjunct in the discrimination of ovarian cancer patients from those with benign ovarian tumors and from those with advanced colon cancer. Today, optimal management of ovarian cancer patients can only be provided using the CA 125 serum test.},

@article{Poccia2011,
abstract = {The disposition of defects in metal oxides is a key attribute exploited for applications from fuel cells and catalysts to superconducting devices and memristors. The most typical defects are mobile excess oxygens and oxygen vacancies, which can be manipulated by a variety of thermal protocols as well as optical and d.c. electric fields. Here we report the X-ray writing of high-quality superconducting regions, derived from defect ordering, in the superoxygenated layered cuprate, La₂CuO(4+y). Irradiation of a poor superconductor prepared by rapid thermal quenching results first in the growth of ordered regions, with an enhancement of superconductivity becoming visible only after a waiting time, as is characteristic of other systems such as ferroelectrics, where strain must be accommodated for order to become extended. However, in La₂CuO(4+y), we are able to resolve all aspects of the growth of (oxygen) intercalant order, including an extraordinary excursion from low to high and back to low anisotropy of the ordered regions. We can also clearly associate the onset of high-quality superconductivity with defect ordering in two dimensions. Additional experiments with small beams demonstrate a photoresist-free, single-step strategy for writing functional materials.},

We use spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscopy to study the electronic structure of a representative compound CaFe1.94Co0.06As2 in the "parent" state from which this superconductivity emerges. Static, unidirectional electronic nanostructures of dimension eight times the inter-iron-atom distance a(Fe-Fe) and aligned along the crystal a axis are observed. In contrast, the delocalized electronic states detectable by quasiparticle interference imaging are dispersive along the b axis only and are consistent with a nematic alpha2 band with an apparent band folding having wave vector q vector congruent with +/-2pi/8a(Fe-Fe) along the a axis. All these effects rotate through 90 degrees at orthorhombic twin boundaries, indicating that they are bulk properties. As none of these phenomena are expected merely due to crystal symmetry, underdoped ferropnictides may exhibit a more complex electronic nematic state than originally expected.},

Both the spin and orbital susceptibilities are calculated in the presence of the Coulomb and charge quadrupole interactions. It is found that both orbital and spin fluctuations strongly develop at both \$x \backslash sim 0\$ and 0.4, due to the strong violation of the rigid band picture in LaFeAsO\$\_\{1-x\}\$H\$\_x\$. Based on this result, we discuss the experimental phase diagram, especially the double-dome superconducting phase.

abstract = {Copper K-edge x-ray absorption data indicate that an axial oxygen-centered lattice instability accompanying the 93 K superconducting transition in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is of a pseudo-(anti)ferroelectric type, in that it appears to involve the softening of a double potential well into a structure in which the difference between the two copper-oxygen distances and the barrier height have both decreased. This softer structure is present only at temperatures within a fluctuation region around the transition. A similar process involving the analogous axial oxygen atom also accompanies the superconducting transition in T1Ba(2)Ca(3)Cu(4)O(11), where the superconducting transition temperature T(c) is \~{}120 K. The mean square relative displacement of this oxygen atom in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is also specifically affected by a reduction in the oxygen content and by the substitution of cobalt for copper, providing further evidence for the sensitivity of the displacement to additional factors that also influence the superconductivity. On the basis of the implied coupling of this ionic motion to the superconductivity, a scenario for high-temperature superconductivity is presented in which both phonon and electronic (charge transfer) channels are synergistically involved.},

abstract = {Superconducting single crystals of pure FeTe 1 − x Se x and FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35 doped with Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn, Mo, Cd, In, Pb, Hg, V, Ga, Mg, Al, Ti, Cr, Sr or Nd into Fe ion sites have been grown applying Bridgman's method. It has been found that the sharpness of the transition to the superconducting state in FeTe 1 − x Se x is evidently inversely correlated with the crystallographic quality of the crystals. Among all of the studied dopants only Co, Ni and Cu substitute Fe ions in FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35 crystals. The remaining ions examined do not incorporate into the crystal structure. Nevertheless, they form inclusions together with selenium, tellurium and/or iron, which change the chemical composition of the host matrix and therefore influence the T c value. The small disorder introduced into the magnetic sublattice, by partial replacement of Fe ions by a slight amount of nonmagnetic ions of Cu (\~{}1.5 at.\%) or by magnetic ions of Ni (\~{}2 at.\%) and Co (\~{}5 at.\%) with spin values different than that of the Fe ion, completely suppresses superconductivity in the FeTe 1 − x Se x system. This indicates that, even if superconductivity is observed in the system containing magnetic ions, it cannot survive when the disorder in the magnetic ion sublattice is introduced, most likely because of magnetic scattering of Cooper pairs.},

Oscillations with frequency 1.87 THz onset at approximately 105 K and 130 K for dopings of x = 0.67 (ortho-VIII) and x = 0.75 (ortho-III), respectively. Upon cooling below the superconducting critical temperature (T\_c), the oscillation amplitude is enhanced, the phase shifts by $\backslash$pi, and the frequency softens by $\backslash$delta $\backslash$nu / $\backslash$nu\~{}7\%. A bi-quadratically coupled Landau-Ginzburg model qualitatively describes this behavior as arising from competition between superconducting and CDW orders.},

abstract = {Using polarization-dependent O1s and Cu2p near-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy on detwinned Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-y single crystals, the unoccupied electronic structure of the CuO2 planes and CuO3 chains has been studied. Unlike the conventional picture where superconductivity is related predominantly to the number of planar holes, we find clear evidence for a prominent role of the apical sites. For both under- and overdoped samples the hole states in the planes and chains are identified and hole counts for the relevant orbitals near the Fermi level are derived. Oxygen–deficient as well as oxygen–rich samples show that the holes introduced by replacing Y3+ with Ca2+ appear solely in the planes.},
