\chapter{Introduction}

Here are some of the topics we want to touch upon:

Appearance of local lattice distortions
Anomalies in phonon spectra (from inelastic neutron scattering)
Behavior of normal state resistance (T vs T$^2$)
Atomic structural inhomogeinity
Electronic inhomogeneity
Anomalous isotopic shifts
Experiments with ultrafast spectroscopy (Mihailovic) and two types of carriers
