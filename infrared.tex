\chapter{Infrared spectra}
\label{chap:irSpectra}

In this chapter we present some general observations and discuss with more detail the infrared-active exctitations.
We start with section \ref{sec:classification} describing the general nature of the different excitations. 
In section \ref{sec:irSpectra} we analyze some features that should be present in the infrared spectra followed, in section \ref{sec:irIsotopicShifts}, by a description of the effects that the isotopic $^{16}$O$\rightarrow ^{18}$O substitution has in the spectra. 
Finally we conclude in section \ref{sec:irPhononProj} with some observations about the projections into the phonon coordinates of these infrared-active states.
We defer to appendix \ref{chap:comp_details} some specific details about the calculations, such as the algorithm used and the numerical errors introduced by the truncation in the basis.

\section{Classification of the excitations}
\label{sec:classification}

As previously noted in section \ref{sec:hamiltonian-and-basis}, only for zero charge-lattice couplings the eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) can be described as a direct product of an electronic and a phononic state, that is, eigenstates of the full hamiltonian $H$ are products of eigenstates of $H_{el}$ and $H_{ph}$ respectively.
In this uncoupled scenatio the phonon number opreators $b_Rb^\dagger_R$ and $b_{ir}b^\dagger_{ir}$ have integer values with zero dispersion.
Increasing the value of the coupling parameters produces eigenstates with different mean phonon values and some finite dispersion producing eigenstates that can not be separated as a product of phononic and electronic states.
However, the deviation from this behaviour is smooth in the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$.
That is, a hamiltonian with a small $\lambda_{ir}$ value will have only slighty different eigenstates from the uncoupled hamiltonian.
This mixed eigenstates, in the small couping regime, can be thought of as largely \textit{phononic} or \textit{electronic} in nature.
For larger coupling values the eigenstates are very different from their uncoupled counterparts.
As an illustration of this we show, in figure \ref{fig:electr-proj}, the first electronic excitation for different $\lambda_{ir}$ values, $\psi_{el}(\lambda_{ir})$ projected with itself for the uncoupled system, $\psi_{el}(\lambda_{ir}=0)$.
From this projection we can see that for small coupling values $\psi_{el}$ remains largely unchanged, that is, it remains \textit{electronic} in nature.
In the middle coupling regime the change is strongest with the projection approaching asymptotically to zero at large couplings.
The vertical line in \ref{fig:electr-proj} at $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV, as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:grd-phonon-proj}, represents the $\lambda_{ir}$ value that reproduces the experimentally observed cluster distortion of 0.13 \AA.
At this coupling value the electronic eigenstate has a projection with its uncoupled counterpart near $\sim 0.75$ which indicates that, although it has been somewhat changed, it remains mostly \textit{electronic} in nature.
Similar observations can be made for the rest of the excitations in this model.
For this reason even though the eigenstates, for finite charge-lattice couplings, are not strictly electronic or phononic we will continue to refer to them as such since that interpretation remains useful in the regime of interest to us.
Given the possibility of making such a distinction for the different excitations we will discuss \textit{phononic} and \textit{electronic} excitations separatedly in this chapter and the next chapter respectively.

Since we are setting the charge-lattice coupling parameter to the symmetrical (Raman) vibrational mode ($\lambda_R$) as zero and these excitations are unchanged by an increase in $\lambda_{ir}$ all excitations will have a definite eigenvalue for the Raman number operator $b_R^\dagger b_R$. 
An excitation which, at $\lambda_{ir}=0$, has an eigenvalue of zero for the infrared number operator $b_{ir}^\dagger b_{ir}$ and the electronic part of the hamiltonian $H_{el}$ (i.e. a purely \textit{Raman} excitation) will remain unchanged with a variation of $\lambda_{ir}$.
We will obviate any discussion about these excitations and ignore them for the rest of this thesis. 


\section{Infrared spectra}
\label{sec:irSpectra}

The Peierls-Hubbard model (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) applied to the O(4)-Cu(1)-O(4) cluster in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ should be able to predict some features of the c-axis infrared spectra by looking at the infrared-active excitations.
It should be noted that, since the coupling $\lambda_{ir}$ can be varied smoothly, the hamiltonian eigenstates will not change parity as a function of $\lambda_{ir}$.
Given that an excitation is infrared-active when it has an opposing parity to the ground state, it follows that an infrared-active excitation will remain active across all the $\lambda_{ir}$ domain.
Since we are modelling the asymmetric vibrational (infared) mode in the O(4)-Cu(1)-O(4) cluster as an harmonic oscillator, it can be concluded that the infrared-active excitations, for any $\lambda_{ir}$, will be those that, at $\lambda_{ir}=0$, have an \textit{odd} number of phonons.

Figure \ref{fig:irSpectra} shows the infrared excitations for a range of $\lambda_{ir}$ values.
For $\lambda_{ir}=0$ we have the excitations corresponding to the phononic part of the hamiltonian.
As can be observed, the behaviour of each excitation depends on the number of infrared phonons at zero coupling.
The number of Raman phonons only displaces the excitation in multiples of $\omega_R=500$ cm$^{-1}$.
That is, all the red lines in Fig. \ref{fig:irSpectra} correspond to one infrared phonon and, in ascending order, have zero, one and two Raman phonons.
This is similarly true for the excitations with two (green lines) and three (blue lines) infrared phonons.
Notice that the excitations with two infrared phonon are infrared-inactive since they have the same symmetry as the ground state.

In general, the infrared excitations decrease in energy with $\lambda_{ir}$ reaching asymptotically a lower value for large couplings.
The excitations with one infrared phonon decrease in energy converging to ($0,\omega_R,2\omega_R\ldots$).
However the excitations with two and three infrared phonons converge to ($\omega_{ir},2\omega_{ir},3\omega_{ir}\ldots$).
This recovery of an harmonic behaviour at large $\lambda_{ir}$ can be interpreted as a renormalization of the oscillations with a displaced equilibrium position.

The infrared spectra at $\lambda_{ir}=0$ eV and at the relevant coupling, $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV, is similar albeit with some noticeable differences.
The peak centered at 612.4 cm$^{-1}$ seems to be slightly shifted to 641.4 cm$^{-1}$ with an asymetry produced by the excitation with three infrared phonons at 774.2 cm$^{-1}$ (see inset of Fig. 2 in \cite{MustredeLeon1992} and Fig. 2 in \cite{Salkola1994}).
It should be noted that calculations using a rigid double-well potential for the O(4)-Cu(1)-O(4) cluster are unable to produce this asymmetry.
In the $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV case there is an aditional excitation at 142.4 cm$^{-1}$ which has not yet been observed since other absorptions in this range difficult its detection.

\section{Isotopic shifts}
\label{sec:irIsotopicShifts}

Figure \ref{fig:irIsot} shows the isotopic shifts, as defined by (\ref{eq:isot-shift-def-exc}), for the first infrared excitations.
The shift of the first infared-active excitation starts at its harmonic value of 3.75\% but becomes negative for $\lambda > \sim 0.1$ eV.
It has a negative value for the relevant value $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ signaling the polaronic behaviour of the system.
For large coupling values the shift remains negative but seems to stabilize near 25\% however, there are some numerical instabilities due to float-point arithmetic limitations in the calculations.

The isotopic shifts for the other infrared excitations start also at their harmonic value of 3.75\%, then vary considerably and later return to the harmonic value again.
They are smaller but still positive for $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$.
The strongest variation is in the middle coupling regime
