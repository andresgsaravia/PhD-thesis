\chapter{Electronic excitations}
\label{chap:electronic}

We now turn our attention to the other kind of excitations present in the model hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}), namely, the \textit{electronic} excitations that, in the absence of charge-lattice coupling, arise from the $H_{el}$ term (\ref{eq:electronic-part}).
These excitations are inactive in infrared and Raman spectroscopies but could be accessible by electronic probes.

Unlike $H_{ph}$, the electronic term $H_{el}$ is not infinite dimentional since it depends only on the position of the charges in the atomic sites. 
Using the labelling convention stated in (\ref{eq:basis-set}), it can be expressed as the following 9x9 matrix:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Hel-matrix} \left( \begin{array}{ccccccccc} 
U+2E_0 &\;\;t\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;t\;\;&0&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&0 \\
t&0&t&0&t&0&0&0&0 \\
0&t&2E_0 &0&0&t&0&0&0 \\
t&0&0&0&t&0&t&0&0 \\
0&t&0&t&U-2E_0 &t&0&t&0 \\
0&0&t&0&t&0&0&0&t \\
0&0&0&t&0&0&2E_0 &t&0 \\
0&0&0&0&t&0&t&0&t \\
0&0&0&0&0&t&0&t&U+2E_0  \end{array} \right)\end{equation}
%
This matrix is easily diagonalized to see that its first excited state has an energy of $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state which is a considerable higher than the phononic energies of 500 and 612.4 cm$^{-1}$.

Since $H_{el-ph}$ mixes electronic and phononic degrees of freedom, a change in the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$ also changes the properties of these excitations.
Similar to the phononic excitations analyzed in the previous chapter, for $\lambda_{ir}>0$, these excitations do not remain eigenstates of $H_{el}$ however, as discussed in section \ref{sec:classification}, in the middle coupling regime they remain mainly electronic in nature so we continue to refer them as such.

In Figure \ref{fig:electrSpectra} we show the energy of the three lowest electronic excitations as a function of $\lambda_{ir}$.
All energies show a monotonically decreasing behaviour with $\lambda_{ir}$, reminiscent of the phononic excitations in Figure \ref{fig:irSpectra} with little change in the small and strong coupling regimes but considerable change is in the middle coupling regime.
The first excitation starts at $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ for $\lambda_{ir}=0$ and converges to $\sim 1122$ cm$^{-1}$ for large $\lambda_{ir}$.
The electronic excitation with one additional infrared phonon also converges to this energy and the presence of a Raman phonon only increases the energy by $\omega_R=500$ cm$^{-1}$ for every $\lambda_{ir}$.

At $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV the first electronic excitation has the lower energy of $\sim 1282$ cm$^{-1}$ however the excitation with one additional infrared phonon has an energy of $\sim 1373$ cm$^{-1}$ which is very close to the $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ value for the first excitation at $\lambda_{ir}=0$.

\section{Projection into definite electronic occupation states}

Since we are using basis states with definite electron occupancy, from the eigenvectors of the (\ref{eq:Hel-matrix}) matrix we can directly see the projections into definite electronic occupation states. The following table summarizes those values omitting equivalent basis states:

\noindent\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Energy (cm$^{-1}$) & 0.0 & 1376.42 & 3825.49 & 4325.12 & 14897.84 & 15329.82 & 53933.30 & 69272.75 & 69309.3 \\
\hline
$\uparrow \downarrow \ - \ -$ & 0.00276 & 0.00000 & 0.00382 & 0.00000 & 0.00090 & 0.00000 & 0.00179 & 0.49618 & 0.49455 \\
$\uparrow\  \downarrow \ -$ & 0.20130 & 0.19717 & 0.24809 & 0.25000 & 0.04045 & 0.05283 & 0.00606 & 0.00191 & 0.00219 \\
$\uparrow \ - \ \downarrow$ & 0.08522 & 0.10566 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 & 0.41451 & 0.39434 & 0.00023 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 \\
$ - \ \uparrow \downarrow \ -$ & 0.01884 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 & 0.00736 & 0.00000 & 0.97174 & 0.00000 & 0.00205 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

We noticed\cite{GarciaSaraviaOrtizdeMontellano2013} that, for the first \textit{electronic} excitation, the projection into states with an electron in each oxygen decreases with an increasing $\lambda_{ir}$ suggesting partial charge localization.
