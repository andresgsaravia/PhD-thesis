\chapter{Electronic excitations}
\label{chap:electronic}

We now turn our attention to the other kind of excitations present in the model hamiltonian (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}), namely, the \textit{electronic} excitations.
These excitations are those that, in the absence of charge-lattice coupling, arise from the $H_{el}$ term (\ref{eq:electronic-part}).
Since they are not antisymmetric to the ground state, they are inactive in infrared and Raman spectroscopies but could be accessible by electronic probes such as ARPES\footnote{Angle Resolved Photo-Emission Spectroscopy}.
It should be noted however that ARPES probes the \textit{occupied} electronic states in a system but such an interpretation is difficult in our model.

Unlike $H_{ph}$, the electronic term $H_{el}$ is not infinite dimentional since it depends only on the position of the charges in the atomic sites. 
Using the labelling convention stated in (\ref{eq:basis-set}), $H_{el}$ can be expressed as the following 9x9 matrix:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Hel-matrix} 
  H_{el} \doteq
  \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccccccccc} 
      U+2E_0 &\;\;t\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;t\;\;&0&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&\;\;0\;\;&0 \\
      t&0&t&0&t&0&0&0&0 \\
      0&t&2E_0 &0&0&t&0&0&0 \\
      t&0&0&0&t&0&t&0&0 \\
      0&t&0&t&U-2E_0 &t&0&t&0 \\
      0&0&t&0&t&0&0&0&t \\
      0&0&0&t&0&0&2E_0 &t&0 \\
      0&0&0&0&t&0&t&0&t \\
      0&0&0&0&0&t&0&t&U+2E_0  
    \end{array} 
  \right)
\end{equation}
%
This matrix is easily diagonalized to see that its first excited state has an energy of $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state which is considerable higher than the phononic energies of 500 and 612.4 cm$^{-1}$.

Since $H_{el-ph}$ mixes electronic and phononic degrees of freedom, a change in the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$ also changes the properties of these excitations.
Similar to the phononic excitations analyzed in the previous chapter these excitations do not remain eigenstates of $H_{el}$ for $\lambda_{ir}>0$ however, as discussed in section \ref{sec:classification}, in the middle coupling regime they remain mainly electronic in nature so we continue to refer them as such.

In Figure \ref{fig:electrSpectra} we show the energy of the three lowest electronic excitations as a function of $\lambda_{ir}$.
All energies show a monotonically decreasing behaviour with $\lambda_{ir}$, reminiscent of the phononic excitations in Figure \ref{fig:irSpectra} with little change in the small and strong coupling regimes but considerable change is in the middle coupling regime.
The first excitation starts at $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ for $\lambda_{ir}=0$ and converges to $\sim 1122$ cm$^{-1}$ for large $\lambda_{ir}$.
The electronic excitation with one additional infrared phonon also converges to this energy.
The presence of a Raman phonon rigidly increases the energies by $\omega_R=500$ cm$^{-1}$ for every $\lambda_{ir}$.

\end{figure}

At $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV the first electronic excitation has the lower energy of $\sim 1282$ cm$^{-1}$ however the excitation with one additional infrared phonon has an energy of $\sim 1373$ cm$^{-1}$ which is very close to the $\sim 1376$ cm$^{-1}$ value for the first excitation at $\lambda_{ir}=0$.

\section{Charge localization}

We use (\ref{eq:electronOccupation}) to find the probability $P(e_1,e_2)$ of finding an excitation with the first and second charges at sites $e_1$ and $e_2$ respectively where $e_i=1,3$ denotes a charge at the oxygen sites and $e_i=2$ at the copper site.
In Figure \ref{fig:electronicOccupations} we show the probabilites for one charge in an oxygen and the other in the copper (top panel) as well as both charges in the opposing oxygen sites (bottom panel).
Since the cluster is symmetric some probabilities are equivalent, such as $P(1,2)=P(2,1)=P(2,3)=P(3,2)$, $P(1,3)=P(3,1)$ and $P(1,1)=P(3,3)$.

  The vertical line marks the relevant $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV value.}

\end{figure}

For the first \textit{electronic} excitation, the projection into states with an electron in each oxygen decreases with an increasing $\lambda_{ir}$ suggesting partial charge localization \cite{GarciaSaraviaOrtizdeMontellano2013}.
