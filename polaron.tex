\chapter{Cluster distortion and bipolaron formation}
\label{chap:ground}

We performed a series of diagonalizations of the hamiltonian matrix (\ref{eq:full-hamiltonian}) using the parameters described in section \ref{sec:model-parameters} with a variable infrared charge-lattice coupling, $\lambda_{ir}$. 
We took $\lambda_{ir}$ values in the representative range from 0 eV to 0.25 eV. 
This range allowed us to explore the behaviour of the system in the small, middle and strong coupling regimes. 
Besides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian we also calculated the mean phonons with their dispersions and the projections into phonon coordinates $(u_{ir}, u_R)$ (see section \ref{sec:lattice-distortions}).

In this chapter we turn our attention to the ground and first excited states of the system.
We will show that in the temperature range of interest only these states have a significant occupation.
Thus the atomic motion in the O(4)-Cu(1)-O(4) cluster can be described by a two level hamiltonian with its levels separated by an energy equal to the difference in energy between the ground and first excites states.
First we calculate the difference in Cu-O bond lengths (if any) as a function of the $\lambda_{ir}$ coupling parameter.
With this we can find the $\lambda_{ir}$ value that reproduces the 0.13 \AA\ observed cluster distortion \cite{MustredeLeon1990}.
From the projection into phonon coordinates we can observe if this distortion is static or dynamic for the different $\lambda_{ir}$ values. 
The presence of a dynamic cluster distortion signals a correlated movement between atomic centers and charged particles, that is, it signals a polaronic behaviour.
The difference between the ground state energy in the absence of electron-lattice interaction ($\lambda_{ir}=0$) and its value for the coupling value where this polaronic behaviour sets can be identified as the \textit{bipolaron binding energy}.
We estimate this binding energy for the experimentally relevant $\lambda_{ir}$ value and compare it to other calculations.
Finally we model an isotopic oxygen substitution $^{16}$O$\rightarrow ^{18}$O and calculate its effects in the bipolaron binding energy

\section{Cu(1)-O(4) local distortion}
\label{sec:grd-phonon-proj}

% Why we care about the polaron-tunneling state? (first ir-excitation) 

From \cite{MustredeLeon1990}

The motion of the O(4) atom in the deep, double well potential $V(z)$ can be described by a two-level Hamiltonian $H=(\omega_T/2)\sigma_z$,  such that $H\ket{A}=+(\omega_T/2)\ket{A}$ and $H\ket{S}=-(\omega_T/2)\ket{S}$, where $\sigma_z$ is a Pauli spin matrixm and $\ket{S},\ket{A}$ denote the (symmetric) ground state and (antisymmetric) first excited state, respectively, separated by an energy $\hbar\omega_T=\hbar\omega_1-\hbar\omega_0$.

The wavefunction projection into phonon coordinates (\ref{eq:phonon-coord-projection}) gives information about the coodinates of the three atoms in the CuO$_2$ cluster.
In particular, the phonon coordinate\footnote{The phonon coordinates are  defined in (\ref{eq:uR}, \ref{eq:uir}).} $u_{ir}$ is directly proportional to the distance distortion in the CuO$_2$ cluster, $d$, as shown in (\ref{eq:dvsuir}).
Figure \ref{fig:phononProjGrd} shows the ground state projected into phonon coordinates $(u_R,u_{ir})$ for three representative electron-lattice coupling values $\lambda_{ir}=0, 0.13$ and 0.25 eV.
The projection along $u_R$ is harmonic in all cases.
From the $\lambda_{ir}=0$ case the wavefunction's projection has a maximum at $u_{ir}=0$ impliying, as expected, there is no distortion in the cluster.
In the middle coupling regime, exemplified in Fig. \ref{fig:phononProjGrd} by $\lambda_{ir}=0.13$ eV, there are clearly two peaks present although they are not fully separated.
Since the probability amplitude is not neglible between the two maxima the system can \textit{tunnel} between both possible configurations with the longer distance in the first oxygen or the second bond.
This observation can be interpreted as a dynamic distortion in the cluster that can only be experimentally identifyied with a technique with a similar timescale (see discussion in secion \ref{sec:dynamic_dist}). 
For greater coupling values the two peaks are completely separated and the distortion becomes static.

  \label{fig:phononProjGrd}
\end{figure}

Since the projection into $u_R$ does not change, giving that we are considering only $\lambda_R=0$, we calculated the projections with $u_R=0$ with variable $u_{ir}$ for different coupling values.
The left panel of figure \ref{fig:uir-vs-coupl} shows a plot of this comparison.
From here we can see that the distortion only sets in for $\lambda_{ir}$ greater than $\sim 0.12$ eV and becomes static (the two peaks are fully separated) for $\lambda_{ir}$ greater that $\sim 0.16$ eV.
In the right panel of figure \ref{fig:uir-vs-coupl} we show the cluster distortion $d$ calculated from the maxima of the previous projection.
Here we can see that the observed cluster distortion of $\sim 0.13$ \AA\ \cite{MustredeLeon1990} is reproduced in the intermedite coupling values. 
In particular, $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV reproduces that distortion.
From this plots we observe that it is only in the narrow range  $\sim 0.12 < \lambda_{ir} < \sim 0.16$ that a dynamical cluster distortion is present.

The polaron-tunneling energy $\hbar\omega_T$, at the relevant $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV is 141.39 cm$^{-1}$.

\section{Bipolaron binding energy}
\label{sec:grd-binding-energy}

The energy of the ground state changes with the coupling parameter $\lambda_{ir}$.
The change in energy, $\Delta\omega_{g}$, between the coupled and uncoupled systems can be identified as the \textit{formation energy}.
In particular, in the region where there is bipolaronic objects present, $\Delta\omega_{g}$ can be interpreted as the \textit{bipolaron binding energy}. 
In figure \ref{fig:polaronFormation} we show the dependency of $\Delta\omega_{g}$ with $\lambda_{ir}$, where we defined

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pol-energy}
  \Delta\omega_{g}(\lambda_{ir}) = \omega_{g}(\lambda_{ir} = 0) - \omega_{g}(\lambda_{ir})
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \input{images/polaronFormation}
  \caption{Bipolaron formation energy as a function of the $\lambda_{ir}$ coupling. The vertical line is drawn at the relevant value $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV.}
  \label{fig:polaronFormation}
\end{figure}

We observe a monotonical behaviour with small dependency in the weak coupling regime becoming stronger with greater coupling values.
In particular, for the $\lambda_{ir}=0.1263$ eV value, which reproduces the observed distortion, we find $\Delta\omega_{g}(0.1263$ eV$) = \sim 38$ meV.
This value compares favorably with the value obtained from femtosecond time-domain spectroscopy ($\sim 45$ meV) for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ \cite{Demsar1999}. 
We also find that if we consider a smaller electron-lattice coupling such that the distortion is 0.08 \AA, as that observed for in plane Cu(2)-O in La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$ \cite{Bianconi1996}, we obtain $E_p \sim 35$ meV, which is also comparable to estimates for the pseudogap formation energy in this system (see Fig. 4b in \cite{Kusar2005}).

\section{Isotopic effects in bipolaron formation}
\label{sec:grd-isotopic}

We turn our attention now to the isotopic shift, $\Delta_g$, of $\omega_g$ under the $^{16}$O$\rightarrow ^{18}$O substitution as defined in (\ref{eq:isot-shift-def-grd}).
Figure \ref{fig:isotPolaronFormation} shows $\Delta_g$ as a function of $\lambda_{ir}$.
Contrary to other isotopic shifts, it does not change sign.
However it shows a maximum in the middle coupling regime, reminiscent of the maximums, minimums and inflection points in the isotopic shifts of all other excitations.

\section{Polaron tunneling}

% Only the ground state and the first ir-excitation are appreciably occupied at the temperatures of interest thus the O(4) motion needs to be described quantum mechanically.
% prove? What is the energy difference (in Kelvin) between the ground state and all the excitations?
% in cite{MustredeLeon1992a} they call $\hbar \omega_T = \Delta\epsilon = \epsilon_1 - \epsilon_0 \sim 80$ K the ``interwell tunneling frequency''

% \hbar\omega_T is the tunneling frequency between the two minima
